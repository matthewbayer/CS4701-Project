        """ FInal exam time, length, guidelines for submission, etc. --- PLEASE READ THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT
Dear all,

this message has attached two files -- they are identical in content, and differ only in format (one is PDF, the other Word).

They contain detailed guidelines for the final exam.

I am on purpose not telling you much  about it in this text, (diabolical, I know...) so that you will read the instructions in the file: finding out on the day of the exam that there is something you don't understand would be stressful and burn useful time for you.

The  high order bit is that we are trying to make the logistics of taking the exam  as easy as possible. In particular, you will not have to be connected to the internet during the length of the exam, except for downloading and uploading the exam.

Now, you may ask, why two files? Though we recommend, if possible, that you enter your answer in the fillable PDF we will provide, you will also have an option to complete your answers in Word, and then generate a PDF (and more) . The two different file allow you to test features that you may depend on t during the test  (e.g., whether your PDF reader has any trouble  filling a text box).

Please take a moment NOW to think about how you want to take your exam (filling a PDF, using Word, using pen and paper) and make sure now that you have down all the logistics to execute on your plan.

So, please read the attached guidelines. And, if some things are unclear, now is the time to ask (well, maybe tomorrow morning... :-) )

Take good care,

Dear all,

please find below a link that will take you to the Github repo for A4.

https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/yz2327/A4

This is the project that takes the place of Prelim 2 and is weighted the same as Prelim 2 previously was  (namely 30% of the total grade) .

As I mentioned in responding to your questions in  @782, you have the option of counting for your credit any two of the following three : Prelim 1, A4, and the final.

The project will give you some experience in manipulating inodes,  the persistent data structures that the file systems keeps for each file it stores.

We are going to begin discussing file systems this week in class, but we want you to get started on this right away.  To get you going, Yunhao has (amazingly!) prepared a YouTube video that contains, we believe, all you need to attack the project starting tomorrow. You can find the video here:

https://youtu.be/EO7nBmw-Scc

and on Canvas under the Module "Intro to A4", which you should be able to reach from this link:

https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/11544/pages/a4-tutorial?module_item_id=435490

You can also find a pointer to it in the handout for the project you’ll find in the repo.

Office Hours

Every project increases the request for office hours. Besides, this is a new  project: we have worked very hard to work out all the kinks, but we have been, so to speak, building the car while driving it: most TAs will be doing the project just a few hours before you.

So, let’s talk about office hours.

I heard from some of you that some office hours have been busy, to the point that you have not been able to get the help you were looking for.  I have discussed this with the teaching staff and we have been exchanging ideas on how to make things more efficient and give to as many students as possible a chance to ask at least one of their questions during office hours.

But, let’s face it: the medium is inefficient: it is yet another thing that we have to recognize and, all of us, learn to live with: from the teaching staff side, it means trying to find ways to optimize the interactions; from your side, it means adapting your behavior so that you can get, in these circumstances, the best possible help.

Which brings me to another thing that I have learned from my TAs: almost all their office hours leading to A3 were empty — just tin the two/three days before the assignment was due there was a spike.

So, to recap:  1) you may need help; 2) office hours immediately before the deadline are unlikely to be able to absorb the load; 3) most office hours before the last bottleneck days are empty.

You are smart Cornell undergrads -- but here is a friendly hint ;-)

       start on your project NOW, and beat the rush.

And be done early: if you don’t  start thinking about it when the project is basically due and fall pray of the “fog of war”, it is a project you can finish relatively quickly.

Due Date


The project is due May 14, at 11:59 pm  Ithaca Time

A public ‘Thank you”

I have been touched by the dedication of the TAs in this class. Preparing a project from nothing takes hard work, and to do so while managing the challenging times we are in is truly spectacular. I realize that it is hard to be thankful to someone who has just created a new project for you to work on, but I hope you too appreciate their dedication.

The best way to repay them for the hard work is to get on with your project soon (today), and, while working at it, to remind yourself that the honor system we live by is a covenant of free people, who, free to be other than honorable, choose instead to be so.""",
        """ Online Lecture and my new office hours
Dear all,

I hope this find you and your family well and safe.

We are about to restart our intellectual journey together: even I can see you rolling your eyes, I hope that deep inside (ok, perhaps really deep inside) you are excitedI

I wanted to share with you how lectures are going to proceed.

Lecture  -- Synchronous delivery

Following the University's guidelines, I am going to deliver lectures synchronously over Zoom at our normal times (Tuesdays and Thursdays, from 1:25 to 2:40 pm EST).

If you go to your calendar on Canvas, you should see entries for each of the classes, with a link that will allow you to join them. (You must be logged into Zoom via your Cornell ID: Choose the "Sign in via SSO" option in zoom.)

Lecture  -- Asynchronous delivery

Just as I did for the last lecture before our long recess, I will post both video and audio of the lectures in modules on Canvas.

Zoom call etiquette

Running a class of our size while trying to make it as interactive as possible is a challenge when we are together -- a virtual meeting makes it even more so.

Here is what we'll do:

-  Please enter by clicking on the zoom link on Canvas -- that way, you'll be automatically authenticated. You need to authenticate yourself to join the call.

- At the beginning of the call you will be muted. You can decide whether to keep your video on or off. Please consider keeping your video on: it's weird enough to teach into the void--at least, seeing some of you will make it less awkward. :-)

- If you would like to ask a question, please click on the Participants tab and then click on the small icon in the shape of a hand. I will periodically stop during the class and go through questions, and will unmute you to give you a chance to ask yours.

- Voicing your questions is the most effective way for us to focus on things that are unclear --but if you would rather not speak up, you can also ask me questions through chat. I will then read your question aloud and answer it.

My Office Hours

I will keep my 3:00 to 4:00 pm  office hour on Tuesdays, but I will move my office hour on Thursdays from 10:00 to 11:00 pm, to make it easier for those of you in a very different time zone.

See you soon!""",
        """ Hi all,

We will hold office hours at the times visible on the website. Some remain unchanged, some are updated, so take a look.

To join online office hours please use the attached Zoom Link below. This meeting room is "open" all day, but will only be accessible to you if a TA is present - so take a look at Piazza in case a TA cancels his office hours short-term or is delayed. It will work as follows:

TA's will admit you into the meeting room where you can queue up for help by using the "raise hand" feature. A TA will see this and service you in invocation order.  You start off muted, but may ask questions by text using the Chat feature "Message Host".

        """ Regarding the no makeup exam policy
It seems that the policy to offer no makeup exams is inherently unfair to students with an exam conflict -- they only receive two opportunities to score well on the exams; everyone else gets 3. We can expect that the latter group will obtain higher overall grades on average.

If a student does not want to attend an exam and chooses to let it be dropped, that is their prerogative. But this is not an option at all for people with conflicts.

Moreover, some students have conflicts for more than one exam and, under the current policy, are likely to fail (or receive a very poor grade in) the course. As this course is required for the CS major, failure is not an option they can afford (and would prevent graduation for students in their final semester).

There are roughly 20 and 10 courses with the same respective exam dates as Prelim 1 and Prelim 2. There are 77 courses with the same final exam date and time as this course.

Several other large courses in the CS department (such as 1110 w/ ~500 students and 3110 w/ ~400 students) indeed offer make-up exams. Since there are 19 TAs for this class, it should not be difficult at all to proctor one or more make-ups per exam.

By University Faculty (Office of the Dean) policy: "Faculty members are urged to accommodate students’ requests for alternative exam times or make-up examinations when students’ exam schedules are sufficiently congested to warrant such accommodation. For example, a student facing a direct conflict or three or more examinations during one twenty-four hour time period merits such accommodation."

As another student mentioned, in the section about prelims: "If a student has conflicting examination schedules, both of which are on the schedule developed at the annual evening prelim scheduling meeting or both of which are not on the schedule, the instructors of the courses involved must consult and agree on how to resolve the conflict. Both instructors must approach this resolution process with a willingness to provide an alternative or early examination."

The Cornell University Registrar adds that the onus to provide a make-up exam is on a course "if [it] is the largest involved". This is likely the case for this course.

Respectfully, exam and university conflicts are typically out of students' control. (Other classes are important and required too.) Therefore, it would be reasonable and proper for make-up examinations to be offered. Please kindly give appropriate consideration again to the policy.""",
        """ Dear all,

you are right. I misspoke and I apologize for that. There was always going to be a makeup for 4410 (in fact, I had already discussed with my assistant how to make that happen before the beginning of the semester). As in years past, the makeup is going to be offered on the same day of the regular exam, but at an earlier time, to avoid conflicts with other classes. I am also scheduled to speak on Monday with Professor Hariharan, to make sure that our times do not overlap and students can take both exams.
If a student cannot attend either exam, then the "drop an exam" policy applies -- that what I meant to say, but that is clearly not what I did say :-)
I will hopefully be able to speak more about timing of the prelims on Tuesday in class , once I have discussed it with Professor Hariharan.

But the bottomline is that, if you are concerned about a conflict with Professor Hariharan's class, you need not be.

I have posted an update syllabus on the web shortly after we suspended classes. In fact, I did it so early that it does not yet include the fact that we'll get back one of the weeks we lost -- so, you can expect that some things will change. In particular, I am still working out the details of the assessment plan of the course.

In regards to how assessment will work for this course, I am still working out the details. This time off from classes has most notably been spent trying to properly transition a large lecture class to my small study (I feel like Stephen Colbert) in a way that will work best for our current situation. Once that show is on the road, further details on the course and assessment will be released. To quell any anxious thoughts, nothing will be due for at least the next week and a half (the closest dealine is for A3, on April 17) and all I expect from you at this time is to come to class enthusiastic and ready to learn, with an added drop of patience for me as we transition to virtual learning.

        """ Prelim 1 - a few notes
Dear all,

I am about to release the grades for Prelim 1, and I thought I should accompany them with some remarks.

First, I understand that a question many of you have is whether, pst COVID, the offer of dropping this prelim is still valid. The answer is yes.

Whatever is going to be the percentage of the final credit in the class  that is going to be based on exams, it is going to be computed either using solely the final exam or by splitting it across  both the final and the prelim exam, whatever is going to be best for you.

Second, the statistics that you will find on Gradescope are inaccurate because they use an incorrect total -- it is using 91; it should use 82; further, all of you have earned one point more that waht Gradescope reports. Explanation below:

----------

Gradescope computed the  maximum possible score to be  91-- it came to that number by computing the sum of all the points that could be earned in the exam.

In computing your score, it did not count the one point you earned by filling in your Cornell id--so, you should mentally add 1 to both your score and to the maximum possible score ---so that the latter grows to 92.

We get down from 92 to 82 because I have decided to count part 2 of the last question (worth 10 points) as extra credit.

----------

Here are the accurate numbers:

Average:  44.1       (53.7%)

Median:   44          (53.7%)

St.Dev:      9.3

Min:         23.5       (28.7%)

Max:        70          (85.4%)

Finally, let me just say, not in a judgmental way, but as your partner in this intellectual journey: you can do much better, and you should do much better.

I am *not* saying "You could have done better" ---I very much realize that, for many of you, it was very hard to concentrate on the exam with all that was happening around you.   I am saying, however, that you can now.

This is the time to regroup and fully engage in what I think is the long lasting lesson of this class, even for those of you who are never going to write a line of operating systems code---how to manage complex systems (not even necessarily computer systems!)  through elegant , powerful, and efficient abstractions.

It was great seeing so many of you on line today. Keep the questions coming during lecture. I am looking forward to seeing you on line soon.

It seems that the policy to offer no makeup exams is inherently unfair to students with an exam conflict -- they only receive two opportunities to score well on the exams; everyone else gets 3. We can expect that the latter group will obtain higher overall grades on average.

If a student does not want to attend an exam and chooses to let it be dropped, that is their prerogative. But this is not an option at all for people with conflicts.

Moreover, some students have conflicts for more than one exam and, under the current policy, are likely to fail (or receive a very poor grade in) the course. As this course is required for the CS major, failure is not an option they can afford (and would prevent graduation for students in their final semester).

There are roughly 20 and 10 courses with the same respective exam dates as Prelim 1 and Prelim 2. There are 77 courses with the same final exam date and time as this course.

Several other large courses in the CS department (such as 1110 w/ ~500 students and 3110 w/ ~400 students) indeed offer make-up exams. Since there are 19 TAs for this class, it should not be difficult at all to proctor one or more make-ups per exam.

By University Faculty (Office of the Dean) policy: "Faculty members are urged to accommodate students’ requests for alternative exam times or make-up examinations when students’ exam schedules are sufficiently congested to warrant such accommodation. For example, a student facing a direct conflict or three or more examinations during one twenty-four hour time period merits such accommodation."

As another student mentioned, in the section about prelims: "If a student has conflicting examination schedules, both of which are on the schedule developed at the annual evening prelim scheduling meeting or both of which are not on the schedule, the instructors of the courses involved must consult and agree on how to resolve the conflict. Both instructors must approach this resolution process with a willingness to provide an alternative or early examination."

The Cornell University Registrar adds that the onus to provide a make-up exam is on a course "if [it] is the largest involved". This is likely the case for this course.

Respectfully, exam and university conflicts are typically out of students' control. (Other classes are important and required too.) Therefore, it would be reasonable and proper for make-up examinations to be offered. Please kindly give appropriate consideration again to the policy.""",

Title: The Principal-Agent Value Alignment Problem in Artificial Intelligence

Abstract:
Much of our success in artificial intelligence stems from the adoption of a simple paradigm: specify an objective or goal, and then use optimization algorithms to identify a behavior (or predictor) that optimally achieves this goal. This has been true since the early days of AI (e.g., search algorithms such as $A^*$ that aim to find the optimal path to a goal state), and this paradigm is common to AI, statistics, control theory, operations research, and economics. Loosely speaking, the field has evaluated the intelligence of an AI system by how efficiently and effectively it optimizes for _its_ objective. This talk will provide an overview of my thesis work, which proposes and explores the consequences of a simple, but consequential, shift in perspective: we should measure the intelligence of an AI system by its ability to optimize for _our_ objectives.

In an ideal world, these measurements would be the same -- all we have to do is write down the correct objective! This is easier said than done: misalignment between the behavior a system designer actually wants and the behavior incentivized by the reward or loss functions they specify is routine, it is commonly observed in a wide variety of practical applications, and fundamental, as a consequence of limited human cognitive capacity. This talk will build up a formal model of this value alignment problem as a cooperative human-robot interaction: an assistance game of partial information between a human principal and an autonomous agent. It will begin with a discussion of a simple instantiation of this game where the human designer takes one action, write down a proxy objective, and the robot attempts to optimize for the true objective by treating the observed proxy as evidence about the intended goal. Next, I will generalize this model to introduce Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning, a general and formal model of this assistance game, and discuss the design of efficient algorithms to solve it. The talk will conclude with a discussion of directions for further research including applications to content recommendation and home robotics, the development of reliable and robust design environments for AI objectives, and the theoretical study of AI regulation by society as a value alignment problem with multiple human principals.

His research focuses on the value alignment problem in artificial intelligence. His goal is to design algorithms that learn about and pursue the intended goal of their users, designers, and society in general. His recent work has focused on algorithms for human-robot interaction with unknown preferences and reliability engineering for learning systems. Before coming to UC Berkeley he received his Master's from MIT on integrated task and motion planning for long-horizon robot control. He is interested in work that bridges the gap between AI theory and practical applications like robotics and his research draws upon related work in psychology, economics, and law/policy.""",

Title: Foundations of Lattice-Based Cryptography

Abstract:
There has been a recent revolution in cryptography due to the introduction of lattice-based constructions. These are cryptographic schemes whose security relies on the presumed hardness of certain computational problems over ubiquitous (and beautiful) geometric objects called lattices. Their many applications (e.g., fully homomorphic encryption) and security against adversaries with quantum computers has created some urgency to deploy lattice-based schemes widely over the next few years. For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is in the process of standardizing lattice-based cryptography, and Google has already implemented such a scheme in its Canary browser.

The security of the proposed schemes relies crucially on the assumption that our current best algorithms (both classical and quantum) for the relevant computational lattice problems cannot be improved by even a relatively small amount. I will discuss the state of the art in the study of this assumption. In particular, I will describe the fastest known algorithms for these problems (and potential directions to improve them) as well as a recent series of hardness results that use the tools of fine-grained complexity to provide strong evidence for the security of lattice-based cryptography.

Here is some helpful information in response to some questions on signal that I have frequently answered.

To understand the purpose of system calls like signal(), which is used in interrupts_disable(), it is a good idea to check the Linux manual page. In this case, the specific page we want to look at is given here: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/signal.2.html


Now, going through the manual page, you would know what the system call does. In this case, we know signal(int signum, sighandler_t handler) specifies a handler for signum. In simpler terms, we are altering the behavior that is exhibited when a process P receives a signal (denoted by signum) and this new behavior is specified by handler. Now, the provided code for interrupts_disable() is


signal(SIGINT, SIG_IGN);

We can deduce what this means. Sending SIGINT to process P will result in behavior defined by SIG_IGN. Note that signal only specifies the handler and does not send a signal itself. SIGINT is again a standard signal defined on another page of the Linux manual here: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html.
In this case, we find it is an interrupt from a keyboard. On the manual page for the signal call, you can find that SIG_IGN causes a signal to be ignored.

This should give you a basis to proceed with the rest of A1.

Note, you can also see the docs by typing "man (thing you are looking for)" in the terminal so "man signal" will bring up information regarding signal.""",

Title: Data Structures Meet Circuits and Cryptography

Abstract:
In this talk we will discuss the state of the art in the field of data structure lower bounds and surprising connections between such lower bounds, circuit complexity, and cryptography. Proving such limitations on data structures and circuits has been a fundamental research endeavor for several decades, with connections to efficient parallel computation and the P-vs-NP question. Despite much effort, our best lower bounds in both fields have remained unchanged since the 1980s.

We show a surprising connection between both fields, offering an explanation for this lack of progress. Specifically, we show that any improvement on the best known lower bound for a (linear) data structure problem would imply new circuit lower bounds, and vice versa. Our proof uses a new connection between additive and multiplicative sparse matrix factorizations.

We continue this line of research by showing that data structure lower bounds for a specific class of problems are equivalent to a certain kind of cryptography. We use this connection to construct surprising (crypto-inspired) data structures for the 3-SUM problem, refuting a data structure variant of the 3SUM conjecture due to Goldstein et al.

According to @250, we should avoid using broadcast as much as possible, as long as it does not affect the correctness.

But the signaled person B still needs to wait on other conditions. In this case, should we let A use broadcast instead of signal, or should we simply let B signal the next person waiting?

It seems the second way fits more with the "avoiding broadcast" principle mentioned so far, but this also seems random/unfair with potentially more blocking in this kind of passing signal around.

More to the extreme, one can also do this kind of passing signal around to avoid using broadcasting even when there exists a group of people potentially satisfy the condition (e.g. when the last econ student is leaving, and all waiting AEM students can enter). For example, naively each person can just send out all the condition signals before going to the waiting state. But I think in this case the blocking brought by passing signals one by one is even less efficient than broadcasting.

I am confused on how any of our code with locks is interrupt safe. Say I acquire a lock and am in the middle of a critical section and get interrupted.

In handling that signal I try to acquire the lock that I already have, and then get put on the queue for the lock that I myself have. Deadlock.

Also, I see that in acquiring the lock that part is interrupt safe because of the disable/enable. But, if right after acquiring the lock we just use it in a non interrupt safe way why even bother with the enable/disable in lock acquire in a multiprocessor with test and set (other than performance for the spin lock to get used as quickly as possible). Also after doing some reading online it seems that on multiprocessors with test and set you don't need to enable and disable for lock acquire, but its just done for performance.

1) What purpose does the "suspend" function perform? Apart from the spinlocks, it looks just like the yield() function we saw in the lecture on Jan 30. So is it supposed to be "suspending" the current process and letting another process run?
2) I understand the need to do spinlock.release() for the else-clause of lock.acquire(), but suppose the program ran and it went to the if-clause instead. Calling suspend() will have released the spinlock (with lock->release()) already, so is there a need to call spinlock.release() in lock.acquire() again at the end? (Okay this is answered in @265 so I am good)
3) I think this applies to things taught in previous lectures too but I am curious as to why exactly do we need to explicitly modify the state to WAITING/RUNNING? Like I understand the concept of the process lifecycle but I don't see why is there a need to specifically call next->state = RUNNING or current->state = WAITING since the state attribute don't seem to be used anywhere else (like as a branch condition etc.) from what I see.

So in other words is a recruiter considered waiting as soon as they try to acquire the lock to the fair (waiting in line for the checkpoint), or is a recruiter only considered waiting when they are waiting inside the critical section (got to the front of the line at some point, but then didn't get in the fair because it was full)""",

Dear all,

I hope this finds you and your family well and safe. It's been already a week without classes, and, believe it or not, I miss you guys :-) What I can tell you is that we are all working as well as we can to make sure that we can continue to be a vibrant learning community once classes start again.

As I, like you, find myself largely isolated from family, friends and colleagues (but for videoconferencing--score one for CS!) I am struck by the fact that there are two aspects to being an effective learning community.

The first is learning. As I mentioned, I am working on trying to understand how to best structure the course in the current situation and connect with you in the weeks ahead. Some things I have begun to learn--and I know I will need to learn more. You may find it amusing, but the CS faculty has actually created a Piazza group where we can share with one another ideas and best practices, and ask questions of each other!  Bottom line: there is much confusion in all of our lives, but of one thing you can be certain: everyone here is committed to our teaching mission, and hard at work to continue it in these challenging new environment.

In that vein,  am going to post later a poll to learn where (which time zone) each of you will be until the semester ends: that will help us determine how to best serve you with office hours.

The second, though, is community. In a class as large as ours, even when everything is well, it is easy to feel lost; now that we are scattered everywhere, staying connected is even harder.  I am not just talking about being up to date with the latest ways in which the University is tuning its policies in response to COVID-19 (you can find the current information by following this link: https://www.cornell.edu/coronavirus/teaching-learning/students.cfm), but also about connecting with one another, you and me and among you all.

So, I decided, starting today, to create every day a post where, I hope,  we will get to share something beautiful or funny or... that you saw, or  listened to, or  read, or watched,  discussed with a friend today -- or something that you think is just cool and want to share.  So look for the "Daily Post" and add your thoughts as you see fit. And feel free, if you are the first on Piazza on a given day, to start the Daily Post -- it may turn into  a fun collective diary for this crazy time.  I have just posted mine for today!""",

Dear all,

I hope you are well! On my front, today was a day of endless Zoom calls with prospective students and University wide committees: if you are like me, this is the kind of day that calls for chocolate!

So, since several of you asked, I am attaching below the recipe for the chocolate lava cake of the other day! Speaking of recipes -- we come from all over, and from different culinary traditions. What is your favorite dish and why? I'll tell you mine tomorrow :-)

But, now, chocolate!

INGREDIENTS
6 ounces (170g) high quality semi-sweet chocolate*
1/2 cup (115g; 1 stick) unsalted butter
1/4 cup (31g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)
1/2 cup (60g) confectioners’ sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
2 large egg yolks*
optional for topping: ice cream, raspberries, and/or chocolate syrup
INSTRUCTIONS
Spray four 6 ounce ramekin with nonstick cooking spray and dust with cocoa powder. This ensures the cakes will seamlessly come out of the ramekins when inverted onto a plate in step 7. *Or spray half of a 12-count muffin pan and dust with cocoa powder. If baking in a muffin pan, the recipe will yield 6 cakes.
Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).
Coarsely chop the chocolate. Place butter into a medium heat-proof bowl, then add chopped chocolate on top. Microwave on high in 10 second increments, stirring after each until completely smooth. Set aside.
Whisk the flour, confectioners’ sugar, and salt together in a small bowl. Whisk the eggs and egg yolks together until combined in another small bowl. Pour the flour mixture and eggs into the bowl of chocolate. Slowly stir everything together using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. If there are any lumps, gently use your whisk to rid them. The batter will be slightly thick.
Spoon chocolate batter evenly into each prepared ramekin or muffin cup.
Place ramekins onto a baking sheet and bake for 12-14 minutes until the sides appear solid and firm– the tops will still look soft. *If baking in a muffin pan, the cakes only take about 8-10 minutes.
Allow to cool for 1 minute, then cover each with an inverted plate and turn over. Use an oven mitt because those ramekins are hot! The cakes should release easily from the ramekin. *If you used a muffin pan, use a spoon to release the cakes from the pan and place each upside down on plates.
Add toppings. Serve immediately.""",

Dear all,

I hope this finds you very well! I hope that the reason most of you are not sharing your favorite dishes with the rest of us is because your are busy eating them... though perhaps it's for the best. The posts you did send were awesome, and made it difficult for me to not run to the kitchen.

Anyway, I told you that today I would share my favorite dish. It is a difficult choice, as Bologna, the city i am from, is famous *among Italians* for being the nation's food capital.  Should I go for tagliatelle, egg-based past ribbons, in the glorious gold of eggs' yolk or the green of spinach, with a bolognese sauce or  with prosciutto?

Tagliatelle Bologna - Tagliatelle al ragù - Trattoria Annamaria

Or should I go with Lasagne Verdi, my daughters' favorite dish, and the *real* lasagne, with neither ricotta nor tomato sauce? More about it here:



But no--there could only be one choice: tortellini. After all, it is not every dish that has its recipe registered in city hall ( [in Italian] and its shape, according to legend, due to an innleeper who got a glance of Venus (long story) and tried to reproduce her navel in a ribbon of pasta (would that be the first thing that would come to your mind?)

Tortellini are *NOT* the abomination with cheese inside that you see served in a *gulp* salad---perhaps, with a pesto sauce. I am not sure how you'd feel about seeing someone putting ketchup on your favorite apple pie and claiming that it's wholesome American food... [By the way, the day I started here as a Ph.D. student, just off the plane, the Department had a nice welcome  reception at the Johnson Museum, where they served... you guessed it ;-) )

Every family has its own recipe--and holds on to it. Yes, there is the official recipe you saw above, but each family believes they know better! I would give you mine, but then I'd have to kill you...

Anyway, this is what we have at Christmas. Christmas Vigil is spent together, singing, chatting, eating munchies, and folding tortellini: here you see us at work (and the results). It is a wonderful time.

From time to time, I actually have all my graduate students over---we spend the afternoon making tortellini and eat them around a long long table in the evening...

Sorry I am late--it was a long day of Zoom meetings!

Today was a beautiful day in Ithaca. Sunny and relatively warm.

It got me thinking how much I love this place---and I quickly found myself  thinking about  Ithaka, by the Greek poet Cavafy. You may have heard this poem  already during your time on campus, as it is bound to touch deeply those of us (and I suspect it is most of us) that can identify their own personal and intellectual journey in the one the poem evokes.  You can find it here.

I first heard it during my Ph.D. commencement, where it was recited by the then President, the legendary Frank H. T. Rhodes (what an amazing guy!) and made a big impression on me.

Skip ahead 18 years: I am a professor at UT Austin, and my greek student, Manos Kapritsos, has defended his Ph.D. We have become, as thankfully happens with many of my Ph.D. students, good friends over the years -- and he invites me and my wife out to dinner, to celebrate quietly after his defense. I have a gift for him and, when I give to him, he tells me he also has something for me. From nowhere, he takes out this large rectangle -- I suspect a framed poster.

I am attaching below a picture of what it really was.

Manos had actually beautifully hand written  the poem, both  in Greek and in English translation (he even burnt the borders of the paper sheets!) and had it framed  (he had told me a couple of years before that Cavafy was his favorite Greek poet, and I had told him how special this poem was for me).

I had no idea that two years later, I would once again reach Ithaca... It now hangs in my study :-)""",

One of the mot enthusiastic supporters of Cornell's decision to send us working from home is our cat, Yoda.



You may get to know him more when I start teaching from home, since he really likes to have attention when he feels it would be most annoying for me to give it to him ;-), so I expect sooner or later he will parade in front of the camera.

He is 13 -- we  surprised our kids one weekend by driving to  the SPCA to pick him up. He was tiny, but with gigantic ears -- hence the name. Our family was split on cat vs dogs: two of us were for dogs (full disclosure: a dog was supposed to be my Ph.D. gift: it is still supposed to be my Ph.D. gift...); one for cats; one for "do we really have to?".

Yoda has conquered us all though, in part because at times he seems  to think he is a dog (like when he fetches---we used to play like that every day when he was younger), and in part because of his athleticism: prior to fetching the little toy we were throwing him, he would actually try to block it by jumping in mid air.

Hi,

I am going through the March 12th Zoom lecture and the slides. On slide 36 it says that marking the protection of a segment as read/shared maintains isolation. I thought isolation meant that multiple processes have virtual address spaces that map to disjoint ranges in physical memory at any point in time. However, with read/shared protection, two processes running on two different CPUs could have virtual addresses that map to the same physical addresses simultaneously (for example, if both were executing the same code in parallel). How does this maintain isolation using this definition of isolation? I understand how this would maintain protection, but not isolation.

Grades for A2 are now fully released and regrade requests for A2 are open until April 14th.

For this problem, we used a "bucket grading scheme":

The problem specifies “score buckets” which group together a set of mistakes with a similar level of seriousness. Your score is equal to the bucket in which your most serious mistake is.
Additionally. there is a 1 pt deduction for not using the constant we provided and a 1 pt deduction for leaving in debugger asserts/prints.
Below are the rough score buckets and common mistakes that fall under them.

10/10:

no mistakes from below and no deductions.
9/10:

Minor calculation or arithmetic errors.
e.g. in calculating the CS entry condition.
Trivial syntax mistakes.
Minor efficiency problems:
Unnecessary signals, e.g. signalling a waiting CS student in cs_enter.
Unguarded signals, e.g. no appropriate if checks around signals.
7/10:

Problem invariants are trivialized or bottlenecked:
e.g. only 1 student is allowed in the fair, maximum 1 AEM/econ student is allowed in the fair, students wait to enter until there are no recruiters inside the fair...
1 problem invariant is broken (except for the ones caused due to minor mistakes mentioned in the previous bucket)
e.g. the recruiter invariant is broken because the number of recruiters waiting outside the fair is tracked incorrectly.
Major efficiency problems:
e.g. relying on frequent broadcasts for liveness, having unguarded broadcasts
3/10:

Multiple invariants are broken (unless the reasons are covered in the previous buckets).
Submission starves or deadlocks (unless the reasons are covered by mistakes in the previous buckets).
Any serious commandment breaking behavior.
0/10:

Unimplemented or effectively unimplemented.
Common Mistakes:

Common mistakes that lead to invariant trivialization or bottlenecks are:

1. Missing that an Econ/AEM student or a recruiter entering the fair might satisfy the safety condition for waiting CS students.

2. Missing that multiple waiting Econ/AEM students can enter once the last AEM/Econ student leaves.

3. Missing that a signaled thread does not necessarily run immediately after the current thread.

A common example of (3) is using if/else or if/elif/else for signalling/broadcasting in _leave functions incorrectly.

Using if/else for signalling is as follows:

if <recruiter condition holds>:
	<signal recruiter>
else:
	if <CS student condition holds>:
		<signal CS student>
	if ....
Now, consider the following example: Inside the room (capacity 500) there are 500 students. Because the room is full, there is 1 recruiter waiting outside. There are also 499 Econ students waiting to enter. When one student that is inside the fair leaves, it will only signal the recruiter. However, before the recruiter thread starts executing, all the other students also leave. Since there is still a recruiter waiting, they all only signal the recruiter again. Only the recruiter wakes up and enters an empty room but the Econ students are still waiting to enter needlessly outside.

For this type of signalling to work, you need to include additional signalling/broadcasting in some *_enter functions (in accordance with how your solution is written).

Common mistakes that lead to major efficiency issues are:

1. Using an insufficient number of condition variables.

2. Making multiple types of students and recruiters wait on the same condition variable.

e.g. having one condition variable per invariant. This usually means there is a "capacity" condition variable that must be broadcasted when anyone leaves. So even when a single student leaves, everyone waiting on the capacity invariant may be woken up, even though only 1 of them can enter.""",

I also want to clarify that are the access bits of only the code segment (that the child tried to modify) changed to have write permission for both the child and parent processes or are the access bits of other segments (that could be modified but haven't been modified yet by either process) changed to have write permission as well?""",

The question says that students who are going in the same direction can go at once.

To me that seems to mean that given that the light is in their favor a student should never touch any semaphore in any way because that would involve synchronizing between threads (can't even do a V operation because then the students are not entering at the same time as one V goes through first).

However if the light is not in their favor then the student would have to end up calling P on a semaphore that is at 0 in order to suspend, and that student would only be able to enter once it is no longer 0 which could only be accomplished by a student who has the light in their favor touching a semaphore.

This is a contradiction so my interpretation of the spec is impossible. So what are we to interpret "cross at once" to mean, as there is no way for two students to board at the exact same time without there being some synchronization between them.

If an implementation satisfied: as long as the light is for boarding and a student is trying to board then the light will not switch and no student can depart, and vice versa for departing, would that count as a proper implementation. Even though students still are boarding one at a time technically rather than at once, but this seems like the only possible way. """,

Suppose none of the functions we need to implement finished until after the second lambda task arrived, at which point one finished.

Does that mean ino->size is actually saying the number of blocks the inode is taking or it is just an inode taking 4 bytes of information? """,

2. If we can't assume this, do we count how many addresses that indirect block has and then allocate blocks if we need more?

To verify this, I implemented a simple mutex lock in place of a reader/writer lock as suggested in @888_f1. However, when I do this, part2 still errors (still at line 60) which seems to me that it is actually my part1 that is wrong.

To explore this further, I changed LARGE_FILE_SIZE and N_READ_WRITE_TEST to various smaller values (e.g. LARGE_FILE_SIZE > BLOCK_SIZE*8; 5 < N_READ_WRITE_TEST < 1000). I found that changing these values impacts whether I get 0, 5, or 10/10 (i.e. whether I fail in fixed size file test, varied size file test, or neither). However, I do not understand what this implies. With the original numbers, the error occurs in fixed size file test.

When part2 errors, I print out the str1 and str2 and find that they are completely different with no overlap. I have accounted for freeing blocks when the size of the written file is smaller than the previous file.

First of all, I want to thank the course staff for already being very accommodating this semester; however, I think having 2 hours to complete the final will be a major source of stress for many people. There are 3 main reasons why I think we should have more time:

1) Although there are many classes that are giving us a similar time frame, I think most of them can be justified by having open notes. On the other hand, OS is a class with little knowledge that can be useful from just being memorized. If you don't really understand a concept before starting the exam, it is unlikely that looking at the slides in the middle of your exam will help you apply that concept.

2) Many people have difficulties completing OS exams under normal circumstances, which is a big reason the means are historically low. Why keep the same time frame under extraordinary circumstances, when people will likely be even less prepared and focused?

3) Cheating is inevitable. Many of my classes have had rather... strange prelim distributions, with crazy high standard deviations. One of the biggest advantages that cheaters have is the limited time. When they work with others or have access to answers, they can finish the exam in half the time it takes non-cheaters. Giving us more time would help to close the gap.

When it tries to read inum = 52, it correctly gets the direct data block IDs, however, when it begins reading from the indirect block, the first few IDs appear to be noise, IDs with index 10 - 17 in the indirect block are IDs from inum = 51's indirect block, more noise between index 18 - 19, IDs with index 20 - 51 in the indirect block are also IDs from inum = 51's indirect block, and then finally more noise until the 55th index in the indirect block.

I'm confused as how this is happening as inum = 51 was able to be read correctly when it also requires an indirect block. Additionally, if the inum = 52's indirect block was pointing to inum = 51's block, then there shouldn't be random noise in between sections. Where could this bug be coming from? Direct blocks and the first indirect block appear to be working correctly

EDIT: it appears the incorrect ID and indexes in inum 52 correspond to inum 51's correct ID and indexes so maybe inum 52 has inum 51's indirect block? Doesn't explain why there's noise in it though or how 52 is able to get it""",

Hi,

First off I would like to thank Professor Alvisi and all the TAs for the spectacular job you've done in maintaining the great quality of this class after we went online.

I am now sort of in a scary scenario though, and I am sure many other students are stressed about similar situations. Say we did ok or well on P1, and decided we'd do A4 and not the final (or vice versa but not both). By now, we are basically locked into this decision, but A4/final exam grades aren't out and if they ours isn't as high as we may have expected (or wanted to achieve), we might end up with a bad grade in the class if we are still graded despite the previous preconception that we may have ended up with a good grade. This uncertainty is just stressful (more so if you won't get grades before the deadline), and given S/U petitions are allowed, Cornell seems to acknowledge this. I was just wondering if it is possible we get a very rough estimate of our grade before the S/U petition deadline? I believe this would be in line with what I perceive to be at least one of the points of this deadline. If A4/final grades aren't ready by then, maybe something like "this will be your grade approximately if you get A on A4, B on A4, 0 on A4, 0 on final, etc". 

I realize that this might be a good amount of work. I don't want to sound demanding, but this really has me stressed out now given I thought I'd be able to get more points on A4 than I was able to (even starting early).

Very much appreciated - if anything for your time reading this post.""",
