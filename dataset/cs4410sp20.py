""" FInal exam time, length, guidelines for submission, etc. --- PLEASE READ THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT
Dear all,

this message has attached two files -- they are identical in content, and differ only in format (one is PDF, the other Word).

They contain detailed guidelines for the final exam.

I am on purpose not telling you much  about it in this text, (diabolical, I know...) so that you will read the instructions in the file: finding out on the day of the exam that there is something you don't understand would be stressful and burn useful time for you. 

The  high order bit is that we are trying to make the logistics of taking the exam  as easy as possible. In particular, you will not have to be connected to the internet during the length of the exam, except for downloading and uploading the exam.

Now, you may ask, why two files? Though we recommend, if possible, that you enter your answer in the fillable PDF we will provide, you will also have an option to complete your answers in Word, and then generate a PDF (and more) . The two different file allow you to test features that you may depend on t during the test  (e.g., whether your PDF reader has any trouble  filling a text box).

Please take a moment NOW to think about how you want to take your exam (filling a PDF, using Word, using pen and paper) and make sure now that you have down all the logistics to execute on your plan.

So, please read the attached guidelines. And, if some things are unclear, now is the time to ask (well, maybe tomorrow morning... :-) ) 

Take good care,

""" New project A4 released
Dear all,

please find below a link that will take you to the Github repo for A4.

https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/yz2327/A4

This is the project that takes the place of Prelim 2 and is weighted the same as Prelim 2 previously was  (namely 30% of the total grade) .

As I mentioned in responding to your questions in  @782, you have the option of counting for your credit any two of the following three : Prelim 1, A4, and the final.

The project will give you some experience in manipulating inodes,  the persistent data structures that the file systems keeps for each file it stores.

We are going to begin discussing file systems this week in class, but we want you to get started on this right away.  To get you going, Yunhao has (amazingly!) prepared a YouTube video that contains, we believe, all you need to attack the project starting tomorrow. You can find the video here:

https://youtu.be/EO7nBmw-Scc

and on Canvas under the Module "Intro to A4", which you should be able to reach from this link:

https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/11544/pages/a4-tutorial?module_item_id=435490

You can also find a pointer to it in the handout for the project you’ll find in the repo.

Office Hours

Every project increases the request for office hours. Besides, this is a new  project: we have worked very hard to work out all the kinks, but we have been, so to speak, building the car while driving it: most TAs will be doing the project just a few hours before you.

So, let’s talk about office hours.

I heard from some of you that some office hours have been busy, to the point that you have not been able to get the help you were looking for.  I have discussed this with the teaching staff and we have been exchanging ideas on how to make things more efficient and give to as many students as possible a chance to ask at least one of their questions during office hours.

But, let’s face it: the medium is inefficient: it is yet another thing that we have to recognize and, all of us, learn to live with: from the teaching staff side, it means trying to find ways to optimize the interactions; from your side, it means adapting your behavior so that you can get, in these circumstances, the best possible help.

Which brings me to another thing that I have learned from my TAs: almost all their office hours leading to A3 were empty — just tin the two/three days before the assignment was due there was a spike.

So, to recap:  1) you may need help; 2) office hours immediately before the deadline are unlikely to be able to absorb the load; 3) most office hours before the last bottleneck days are empty. 

You are smart Cornell undergrads -- but here is a friendly hint ;-)

       start on your project NOW, and beat the rush.

And be done early: if you don’t  start thinking about it when the project is basically due and fall pray of the “fog of war”, it is a project you can finish relatively quickly.

Due Date


The project is due May 14, at 11:59 pm  Ithaca Time

A public ‘Thank you”

I have been touched by the dedication of the TAs in this class. Preparing a project from nothing takes hard work, and to do so while managing the challenging times we are in is truly spectacular. I realize that it is hard to be thankful to someone who has just created a new project for you to work on, but I hope you too appreciate their dedication.

The best way to repay them for the hard work is to get on with your project soon (today), and, while working at it, to remind yourself that the honor system we live by is a covenant of free people, who, free to be other than honorable, choose instead to be so.""",
""" Online Lecture and my new office hours
Dear all,

I hope this find you and your family well and safe. 

We are about to restart our intellectual journey together: even I can see you rolling your eyes, I hope that deep inside (ok, perhaps really deep inside) you are excitedI

I wanted to share with you how lectures are going to proceed.

Lecture  -- Synchronous delivery

Following the University's guidelines, I am going to deliver lectures synchronously over Zoom at our normal times (Tuesdays and Thursdays, from 1:25 to 2:40 pm EST).

If you go to your calendar on Canvas, you should see entries for each of the classes, with a link that will allow you to join them. (You must be logged into Zoom via your Cornell ID: Choose the "Sign in via SSO" option in zoom.)

Lecture  -- Asynchronous delivery

Just as I did for the last lecture before our long recess, I will post both video and audio of the lectures in modules on Canvas.

Zoom call etiquette

Running a class of our size while trying to make it as interactive as possible is a challenge when we are together -- a virtual meeting makes it even more so. 

Here is what we'll do:

-  Please enter by clicking on the zoom link on Canvas -- that way, you'll be automatically authenticated. You need to authenticate yourself to join the call. 

- At the beginning of the call you will be muted. You can decide whether to keep your video on or off. Please consider keeping your video on: it's weird enough to teach into the void--at least, seeing some of you will make it less awkward. :-) 

- If you would like to ask a question, please click on the Participants tab and then click on the small icon in the shape of a hand. I will periodically stop during the class and go through questions, and will unmute you to give you a chance to ask yours.

- Voicing your questions is the most effective way for us to focus on things that are unclear --but if you would rather not speak up, you can also ask me questions through chat. I will then read your question aloud and answer it.

My Office Hours

I will keep my 3:00 to 4:00 pm  office hour on Tuesdays, but I will move my office hour on Thursdays from 10:00 to 11:00 pm, to make it easier for those of you in a very different time zone.

See you soon!""",
""" Hi all,

We will hold office hours at the times visible on the website. Some remain unchanged, some are updated, so take a look.

To join online office hours please use the attached Zoom Link below. This meeting room is "open" all day, but will only be accessible to you if a TA is present - so take a look at Piazza in case a TA cancels his office hours short-term or is delayed. It will work as follows:

The case for 3 is fairly straightforward - each thread runs sequentially, so we get 3 increments.

For 1, let's say all of the threads execute their READ instructions at the same time. They all read 0. Each of the threads then adds to what they believe is the counter value of 0, and then writes 1 to the counter variable. The individual increments are thus lost; counter can be 1 because each thread has written the value 1 to wherever counter is in memory.

In the two-level page table, no-TLB, user data cache scenario, the minimum is also 2; we read a page form each level of the page table to get a physical address, and then a cache hit stops us from performing the third memory access.

""" For the first part, the first part of interleaving is the first print statement, since nothing enforces an order between the parent and child, thus you get interleaving between 0 and 1.

However, there is no guarantee that the parent will print the first printf before the child does, which gives the possibility of 1, 10, 0. So so far, we have:

However, when it returns to the main thread, it still uses the loaded value of 6 and returns 7.

""" Regarding the no makeup exam policy
It seems that the policy to offer no makeup exams is inherently unfair to students with an exam conflict -- they only receive two opportunities to score well on the exams; everyone else gets 3. We can expect that the latter group will obtain higher overall grades on average.

If a student does not want to attend an exam and chooses to let it be dropped, that is their prerogative. But this is not an option at all for people with conflicts.

Moreover, some students have conflicts for more than one exam and, under the current policy, are likely to fail (or receive a very poor grade in) the course. As this course is required for the CS major, failure is not an option they can afford (and would prevent graduation for students in their final semester).

There are roughly 20 and 10 courses with the same respective exam dates as Prelim 1 and Prelim 2. There are 77 courses with the same final exam date and time as this course.

Several other large courses in the CS department (such as 1110 w/ ~500 students and 3110 w/ ~400 students) indeed offer make-up exams. Since there are 19 TAs for this class, it should not be difficult at all to proctor one or more make-ups per exam.

By University Faculty (Office of the Dean) policy: "Faculty members are urged to accommodate students’ requests for alternative exam times or make-up examinations when students’ exam schedules are sufficiently congested to warrant such accommodation. For example, a student facing a direct conflict or three or more examinations during one twenty-four hour time period merits such accommodation."

As another student mentioned, in the section about prelims: "If a student has conflicting examination schedules, both of which are on the schedule developed at the annual evening prelim scheduling meeting or both of which are not on the schedule, the instructors of the courses involved must consult and agree on how to resolve the conflict. Both instructors must approach this resolution process with a willingness to provide an alternative or early examination."

The Cornell University Registrar adds that the onus to provide a make-up exam is on a course "if [it] is the largest involved". This is likely the case for this course.

Respectfully, exam and university conflicts are typically out of students' control. (Other classes are important and required too.) Therefore, it would be reasonable and proper for make-up examinations to be offered. Please kindly give appropriate consideration again to the policy.""",
""" Dear all,

you are right. I misspoke and I apologize for that. There was always going to be a makeup for 4410 (in fact, I had already discussed with my assistant how to make that happen before the beginning of the semester). As in years past, the makeup is going to be offered on the same day of the regular exam, but at an earlier time, to avoid conflicts with other classes. I am also scheduled to speak on Monday with Professor Hariharan, to make sure that our times do not overlap and students can take both exams.
If a student cannot attend either exam, then the "drop an exam" policy applies -- that what I meant to say, but that is clearly not what I did say :-)
I will hopefully be able to speak more about timing of the prelims on Tuesday in class , once I have discussed it with Professor Hariharan.

But the bottomline is that, if you are concerned about a conflict with Professor Hariharan's class, you need not be.

Here's what I suggest: if you plan to come to office hours, consider staying around after class and, if you don't want to chat outside Klarman, walk with me to Gates :-)""",

""" Hi. I hope this finds you well and safe!

I have posted an update syllabus on the web shortly after we suspended classes. In fact, I did it so early that it does not yet include the fact that we'll get back one of the weeks we lost -- so, you can expect that some things will change. In particular, I am still working out the details of the assessment plan of the course.  

In regards to how assessment will work for this course, I am still working out the details. This time off from classes has most notably been spent trying to properly transition a large lecture class to my small study (I feel like Stephen Colbert) in a way that will work best for our current situation. Once that show is on the road, further details on the course and assessment will be released. To quell any anxious thoughts, nothing will be due for at least the next week and a half (the closest dealine is for A3, on April 17) and all I expect from you at this time is to come to class enthusiastic and ready to learn, with an added drop of patience for me as we transition to virtual learning. 

Looking forward to seeing you all soon -- and I'll write again before then,""",

I can't make office hours today from 3:00 to 4:00 EST. Just for this time, I am going to have them instead tomorrow evening, from 10:00 to 11:00 pm.

""" Prelim 1 - a few notes
Dear all,

I am about to release the grades for Prelim 1, and I thought I should accompany them with some remarks.

First, I understand that a question many of you have is whether, pst COVID, the offer of dropping this prelim is still valid. The answer is yes.

Whatever is going to be the percentage of the final credit in the class  that is going to be based on exams, it is going to be computed either using solely the final exam or by splitting it across  both the final and the prelim exam, whatever is going to be best for you.

Second, the statistics that you will find on Gradescope are inaccurate because they use an incorrect total -- it is using 91; it should use 82; further, all of you have earned one point more that waht Gradescope reports. Explanation below:

----------

Gradescope computed the  maximum possible score to be  91-- it came to that number by computing the sum of all the points that could be earned in the exam.

In computing your score, it did not count the one point you earned by filling in your Cornell id--so, you should mentally add 1 to both your score and to the maximum possible score ---so that the latter grows to 92.

We get down from 92 to 82 because I have decided to count part 2 of the last question (worth 10 points) as extra credit.

----------

Here are the accurate numbers:

Average:  44.1       (53.7%)

Median:   44          (53.7%)

St.Dev:      9.3

Min:         23.5       (28.7%)

Max:        70          (85.4%)

Finally, let me just say, not in a judgmental way, but as your partner in this intellectual journey: you can do much better, and you should do much better.

I am *not* saying "You could have done better" ---I very much realize that, for many of you, it was very hard to concentrate on the exam with all that was happening around you.   I am saying, however, that you can now.

This is the time to regroup and fully engage in what I think is the long lasting lesson of this class, even for those of you who are never going to write a line of operating systems code---how to manage complex systems (not even necessarily computer systems!)  through elegant , powerful, and efficient abstractions. 

It was great seeing so many of you on line today. Keep the questions coming during lecture. I am looking forward to seeing you on line soon.

Stay safe!""",

On a given disk it seems that there is a head for each surface, is that true?

And if so can only one head on the disk be active at a given time or can multiple surfaces on a single disk be read at the same time?""",

""" A4 late submission deadline incorrect
Currently CMS says that late submissions for A4 will be accepted until May 16th, which allows us to use only 2 slip days. It is my understanding that we may use up to 6 slip days if we have not used any yet. Will the late submission deadline be moved back on CMS?
