        """What Laptop Should I Buy?
Every year I get asked this question by students holding off until they get to college.  So I thought that I would make a Piazza post about it.

Cornell does not want to make specific recommendations, as different majors want different things (and many programs do not want you locking yourself into a specific major early on).  My recommendations assume that you want to major or minor in CS.

These days there are only two things that matter when you buy a computer.

The amount of RAM it has
The quality of the graphics card
CPUs do not matter anymore.  CPUs differences were a big thing in the 90s when a computer could go from brand new to completely obsolete in 6 months (I had that happen to me) because of how fast hardware was changing.  But these days, the i7 has been out for a decade with only minor improvement enhancements over the years.  Sure the i9 is just coming out, but the performance bonus is at best 10%.

On the other hand, adding RAM to a computer can still significantly speed it up.  The more RAM you have, the more programs it can keep open in memory and so it is not spending all its time shutting down and stating up programs.  A CS major should try to have at least 16 GB RAM if possible.  8 GB is enough to do day-to-day tasks, but when you starting doing complicated builds it will choke.  I have not owned a machine with less than 16 GB in 10 years.  These days you can buy machines with 32 GB RAM.

So what about the graphics card?  Graphics cards are like CPUs in the 90s.  The performance improvements each year are astounding.  And there are a lot things that graphics cards are used for these days that are not games.  Machine learning is a big example.  My rule of thumb is that a CS major should have a graphics card capable of running a four-year old first person shooter (at least CS:GO). This will ensure that you will be able to meet the basic needs of any computer science course at Cornell over four years.

Unfortunately, these two things are what really raise the cost of a laptop.  To have the most recent graphics card and 16 GB will often go in the $2500 range (Mac or Windows). No one is asking you to spend this much on a laptop.  But a sub $1000 laptop is not going to cut it.

What Laptop Do You Use?

I actually own both a Mac and a Windows laptop.  They have different advantages for different things.  Because it has Unix as its underlying operating system, Macs are really the preferred development environment these days.  Windows used to have the best tools for programming 10 years ago.  But Apple caught up with the rise of the iPhone, and the Facebook/Google/Amazon world is much more Unix-centric these days. However, Windows machines are still the best for playing and programming games.  And if you are double majoring, there are other majors that absolutely require Windows. While it is possible to run Windows on Mac, this doesn't always work well when games are involved.

The Mac Laptop

I have a two-year old MacBook Pro 15".  I like MacOS a lot and I prefer to do most of my development on that platform.  The 15" MacBook Pro is the only Macintosh laptop that comes with a high-end graphics card (the 13" and the MacBooks use Intel Integrated Graphics).  While Intel Integrated Graphics is not horrible these days, it was a garbage card five years ago and I still carry a grudge.

Even though I have to use a lot of dongles, I like the USB C functionality of the new Macs.  However, I loathe the touch bar and wish I could have bought a Mac without one.  The escape key is one of the most important keys for a programmer and I can no longer feel when I press it.  I am not a fan.

The Windows Laptop

I own an MSI GS65 Stealth. If it weren't for the fact that it actually had to run Windows I would love it more than my Mac.  MSI makes the absolute best gaming laptops these days.  They are solid for gaming, and they do not have these ridiculous form factors (like the Asus Zephyrus) that make it impossible to do actual work on them.

Yes, a lot of people like Razers.  Until they break and you get introduced to the world's worst customer service.""",

The exam is finished and printed.  The format is VERY similar to the past three years (2015, 2016, 2017).  You should put all effort in studying the fall exams from those years.

These exams are designed to be hard to finish in the time allotted (you get 18 min a question) on purpose.  You can leave an entire question blank and still make a B with partial credit on the remaining questions.  You can leave two questions blank (three if the other two questions are near perfect) and still get a C.

Why would I do something like this?  Is it because I am evil?  The purpose of an exam is to determine the limits of your knowledge.  If you could get everything correct, I have no idea what your limits are.  So I need to push you.

My initial impression is that this is easier than last years and closer to 2016 (which was the "perfect" prelim).  Every exam has an A-level question (one which only A students will get a lot of points on), and last year that was intended to be the rectangles question.  However, many people last year had problems with twinsies.  I did not expect that.  So study twinsies on the 2017 exam in some detail please.  

The mean last year was a 73.  In 2016 it was 78 and in 2015 it was 80.  The 2015 mean was way too high (the median was 83) and it forced me to give a harder final to see where everyone's limits were.  Last year the mean was too low and I eased off a lot with the final.  2016 was just right.

_clusters: The list of current clusters S1,…,SkS1,…,Sk
Once again, we have getters and setters for these attributes. But the important methods of class ClusterGroup are the core of the k-means algorithm.

A method to partition the dataset, implementing step 2 of the algorithm (_partition)
