    """Welcome to Piazza!
Students,

Welcome to Piazza! We'll be conducting all class-related discussion here this term. The quicker you begin asking questions on Piazza (rather than via emails), the quicker you'll benefit from the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors. We encourage you to ask questions when you're struggling to understand a concept—you can even do so anonymously.

This is a joined page for both CS4620/CS5620 and CS4621/5621. For questions related to the practicum course, please make sure to tick the "cs4621/5621" tag when you publish.

Platforms/websites we will use for this course:
Course website: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4620/2020fa/ For releasing assignments, course logistics, etc.
Canvas: For lecture materials (videos etc.)
CMS: For submitting assignments, viewing grades, etc.

Zoom: For Wednesday/Thursday discussions/recitations

Hi everyone!

You all should have received an email notification from canvas about assignment 0. In case you didn't or are not yet enrolled in the course, here is the same announcement.

Assignment 0 is now released. It is due on 9/11 at 11:59pm EST. There are no late days allowed. It should be available on cms. Assignment 0 is mostly focused on setting things up on your machine for you to get started coding in JavaScript.

Please head over to the repository link and clone the repository onto your machine. Follow the readme located in the repository for setup instructions.

At the bottom of the readme, there are also instructions for what you need to do and submit for assignment 0. This part should only take a few minutes. We want you to build the server and write a simple test case. Please let us know if you have any question or have any issues!

This post will be for posting possible fixes for those who are having issues accessing the repository.

 It is possible that your account is not a part of the "enterprise" level organization. You can only access user organizations (like the one for CS 4620) if you are a part of the enterprise organization. By default, accounts are not part of the enterprise level organization. It is only until you're part of a user-created organization that github will add you to the enterprise organization. If you're not part of the enterprise organization, you won't be able to see any other Cornell organizations (not just our CS4620 organization). Fixing this should be as simple as creating your own organization. You can do this by going to your profile (top right) -> settings -> organizations ->new organization. Name your organization anything. I'm not sure if it'll be immediately, but once you are part of the organization you created, you should be able to see our (CS4620-F2020) organization. If this doesn't work, post a comment. It could be that you need to be "invited" to an organization. I created an organization for cs 4620 students but I'm holding off on inviting people.

    """Important question about prototyping in Javascript
top of the morning,

I will keep this quick. I was looking through some of my notes on the old JS / Python syntax videos and realised I had a major gap in my knowledge. When we are making Pseudo-classes in JS (because everything is a prototype... yay), does Cup.prototype.material = "ceramic" or more generally GeneralObjName.prootype.GenObjVariable = variableValue apply to all the prototypes from this action but not the superclass Cup? From what I understand a prototype is an instantiated version of the Original obj. This original object is essentially being copied by its prototypes in order to make new objects that are itself something interesting on their own or pseudo-subclasses which can be used to make more interesting Prototypes of their own (Stop me at any point here to correct me because wow... this is probably not easy to follow). Do I always have to add GeneralObjName.prototype.GenObjVariable in order to create variables shared within all the copies of this OG object (Pseudo-class) or would GenObjVariable = variable value simply be enough at this point because everything is presumably being copied from this Original class anyways. Alternatively is this not required in the original class definition but more of a retroactive usage / syntax which allows you to mess with the guts of a file/class on the go (like in command line or in the main function) where you retroactively add a new variable to all instantiated objects (prototypes) of the original object. Extending this from the orignial example, lets say I wanted to add in (through the console / main function) that it is a hot day and want to add a new temperature to every cup (EVER) stating that Cup.prototype.temp = "hot" ==> So is this the main usage of this syntax or am I off my rocker and its solely for the first option outlined above?

tl;dr: My question kind of boils down to Why is this format/syntax done. Why do we care to write the .prototype.Variable instead of just doing material = "ceramic" in the superclass/TechnicallyOriginalObject""",

    """Assignment 1 Clarifications and Hints
This post will be for clarifications or helpful hints for assignment 1.

A1Model.js

Matrix3x3 has static methods to create translation, rotation, and scale matrices.
You may find the applyToPoints function useful to apply a matrix to a list of vertices
For setVertices, be sure to update the corners of the bounding box as well as the vertices. Which vertices determine the bounds?
When calling setOrigin, setTranslation, setRotation, or setScale in updateMatrixProperties, make sure to check what the second parameter "update" should be. It defaults to true.
Make sure to update objectSpaceCorners in renormalize!
A1TransformController.js

 To get the world coordinates of a mouse press, use iaction.getEventPositionInContext(event)
 You may also find it useful to save the initial matrix (as in before the mouse is dragged) in a variable
 Remember that scaling happens around the anchor here. Think about the process for scaling around an arbitrary point, as opposed to scaling around the origin. (i.e. Which transformations need to happen?)
Make sure that after any transformations, you are still in world coordinates after any interaction with the object handles.
Moving the anchor around should not affect the object's other properties - so again, think about what "initial" information you want to store.
A1TransformCenteredController.js

Now, regardless of the anchor position, the object scales with respect to the center of the bounding box. How do we get this value?
You can still think about this as scaling around a specific point rather than around the origin of the world coordinate system. In this case, the point we are scaling around is the object's center; that is, the center of the bounding box.
So, your implementation will be quite similar to A1TransformController.""",

Ok, so I'm having some major issues with how to deal reliably with getting the actual radian value for the rotation.

So looking at Piazza I saw the post on how to do it based on Math.atan however this is now messing with my understanding of how the math behind this works.

To put it simply, I don't understand what to pass into my atan function. How do I convert the elements within the matrix correctly?

when I was working solely with Math.acos(): I passed in anyone of the four values mod 2 pi it is guaranteed to work with

Hi Everyone,
It has been an unusual and challenging start to the semester, and things have played out a bit differently than we expected:

Javascript is less familiar and more of a challenge for students than we anticipated.
Web development and GUI development seem to be new for most of the class
We have about 3x the number of students we expected
We want to do our best to make this class available for everyone who wants to take it. To that end, we’ve taken a lot of your feedback into account and decided the following:

1) To help students with the adjustment to assignment 1

We are giving free slip days on assignment 1. This means that you can hand it in up until Friday, Sept 25 at 11:59pm at no penalty and no cost to slip days, but you must hand it in no later than that.
We are developing a way to run tests that simulate user interactions to help you debug controllers in javascript. We will release those as soon as they are ready (today or tomorrow) to help you check your code.
2) To give students a chance to learn more about how to debug web applications, and to give the staff a chance to develop more scalable strategies for future assignments, we will delay the release of Assignment 2 until the following Friday, October 2.

3) Future assignments will be done in groups to help promote more engagement within the class.

This means that next week there will be no assignment out, and we’ll focus on helping you get more familiar with Javascript, establish your development environment, and learn debugging strategies that will help you with these assignments. We expect you to use this time to familiarize yourself with web development tools. After this, running your code in a working debugger will become a prerequisite for receiving code-specific help at office hours.

We know it’s a crazy semester and want you all to have a good experience in this class. Please continue to let us know if you find ways we can do this better. We will do our best to adapt and keep improving things.

Best,
-Abe & Steve""",

Hi, all.
I noticed that TAs are trying hard to help as many people as possible during office hours, but the queue is just so long, and we all have some problems with homework.

I think it is a good idea to help each other while waiting for the TA's. However, it is also not convenient for TA's to create each breakout room for each topic, and their time is precious.
I believe this problem could be solved using a website called https://gather.town/. I went to a conference this year, and they used this for virtual social gathering, which is cool and pleasant.
You can control your avatar using the keyboard and walk around the virtual 2D scenario. Furthermore, when you are close to somebody else, you can stream videos and audios like zoom.

The cool part is that it provides private gatherings; we can have a large office with many large tables. When you put your avatar around the table, you can only video chat with other people sits on the same table.

For TAs, they only have to have a private 1-1 table to help the students in the queue.

When it comes to screen sharing, TAs can still use the zoom since the website did not provide screen-sharing methods.

Furthermore, for students who are waiting for help, they can group based on questions on themselves and help each other while saving lots of time. Also, when the office in a virtual environment is running, people can always login and communicate with each other.
The disadvantages might be we have to create a virtual environment, which might take some time.

Hopefully this will help!""",

I'm really confused about the expected results for these two tests. In the test case, Q3 has a rotation written as 5/4pi and Q4 has a rotation written as 7/4 pi which fall into quadrants Q3 and Q4.

I also understand that you can represent the values of these radians negativity as Q3 -3/4pi and Q4 -1/4pi.

But it looks like the expected result is actually Q3 1/4pi and Q4 3/4pi.

This makes sense if you account for the fact that a scale of (-1,-1) is essentially a 180 degree rotation. So the rotation 5/4pi will be a rotation 1/4pi and then a 180 degree rotation using scale: (-1,-1). But the test case for Q3 also has it so that the scale = (1,1) .

I've been having trouble conceptualizing what the matrices should look like for removeParent() and attachToNewParent(). I went to take a look at the Nested Transforms demo on the course website. On it, it shows that all of the child objects have an identity matrix at initialization. Intuitively, I suppose it makes sense since they all depend on the parent object's matrix for transformations so since they don't have any transformations yet, their matrices are just the identity matrix. However, the hint in the documentation for attachToNewParent() says "Think about how adding a parent will change the Position & ObjectToWorldMatrix of the model and what should we do to counteract the effect." I originally assumed this meant to do something similar to what was needed for setDragMoveCallback in addInteractionsToAnchor back for assignment 1, but that does not match the matrices shown in the Nested Transforms demo as they have 0's in the M02 and M12 entries of the matrix.

    """Some AniGraph and Assignment 2 GUI updates
Hey Everyone,
I just pushed some updates to AniGraphV2 and Assignment 2 that should make the creative portion of the assignment easier.
Note: None of the files that you are supposed to edit for the core assignment have changed.

Most of the changes are designed to help you explore more ambitious features in the creative portion of the assignment (if you want to). This will be especially relevant to students in 4621 who will have a separate deadline with more extensive requirements that we will elaborate on shortly. If you've already begun work on the creative part of the assignment, check for potential conflicts when pulling (if you aren't super familiar with git, you can always back up your code before you merge just to be safe). If you are still on the core assignment, you are unlikely to have any conflicts.

You may need to update submodules as well: git submodule update --init

Summary of changes:
The changes in code related to the core part of the assignment are minor; you probably won't notice if you haven't gotten to the creative part yet:

If you create a new shape while an existing node is selected, then the new shape is introduced as a child of the selected node. This should make testing a bit easier / less tedious.
The Group selection mode will now bound the first ancestor group (once the related functions in A2Model have been implemented), instead of everything up to the children of the root node. This should make creating animations easier.
Most of the changes are in the ./src/creative folder:

The creative page now has switchable tabs on the left:
one for editing shapes (similar to what you had in A1)
one for editing the scene graph (the same interface you have in the core part of A2)
one for custom controls, which should be much easier to specify in creative.jsx now.
The custom controls tab has a dropdown menu for changing a selected shape's view class.
There is an example custom view class (ATimeView) showing how to create time-varying effects.
I will release a video showing some features of the new code later today.

Best,
-Abe""",

We were trying to implement the setWorldPosition function with an if statement with two cases - either the model doesn't have a parent or model has a parent, but even when we just randomly created one object and tried to move it, it wouldn't move. We changed our setWorldPosition function to move to a position when a model DOES have a parent, and when we created a an object in the GUI with no parent and tried to move it, it did move. So then we console.logged this.getParent() and saw that the object with no parent has a parent which is root model. So does this mean that every single object has a parent no matter what?

This is confusing to me because a lot of the documentation is written with language that implies that if you have just one object, that object shouldn't already have a root model parent object, as the documentation asks us to consider when a model has no parent, and when it does.

Since there has been general confusion about the way the undistort function works (amongst students and us TAs as well), here's an attempt to clear things up:

One confusion of terminology is "input" and "output" because the input and output images of your undistort function and the input and output points for the warping function ϕ go in opposite directions. I think it's good to use "source" and "destination" as the names for the two images and "domain" and "range" for ϕ so as to avoid this confusion. Thus the warping function has the destination image as its domain and the source image as its range. The source image is distorted, and the destination image is undistorted, so it seems safe to call points in the domain of ϕ "undistorted" and the points in its range "distorted."

In the "shift to left" function, in order to make the image move k columns to the left, you set the destination pixel to the value of the source pixel that is k columns to its right. Similarly, to undistort an image, you start from the destination position (undistorted) and compute the source position (distorted).

The other distinction that needs names is between the coordinates where ϕ operates and the ones in which g operates. Let's call ϕ the warp, or warp function, and g the distortion model. This suggests calling the space where coordinates match pixel indices "pixel space" and the space were g operates "distortion-model space."

The matrix M is a mapping from distortion-model space to pixel space.
The distortion model g takes an undistorted position in the distortion-model space, and produces the corresponding distorted point (still in distortion-model space).
The domain and range of the warping function ϕ are both in pixel space, while the actual distortion is modeled by g in distortion-model space. This means that when you apply the distortion model, you will need to transform its domain point from image space and its range point back to pixel space.
The writeup has also been updated in accordance with the explanation.""",

However, it is clear that even if the survey scores were reversed, adequate access to information has not been resolved. 

 

The survey read:

Long queues to access assistance from Professors and TAs waiting 1-2 hrs. and being limited to only one question per session is negatively impacting our ability to learn the material. In addition, the changes that have been made post-A1 have not adequately solved the problem.

 

Based on your experience, how would you rate the access to the support you need to be successful in this class?

 

The results of the survey are as follows:

63%  Unsatisfactory
37%  Satisfactory
While classes may be online, Cornell is not an online university.  I believe we chose to be at this institution specifically for the benefit of expanding our knowledge through collaboration.

 

Respectfully, as is established that TAs are overwhelmed, it would be reasonable to consider the allocation of additional resources.  This could include teaching additional sessions to address common areas of coding difficulty, obtaining additional TAs (possibly from Cornell Tech), and/or creating greater collaboration by expanding existing partnerships into workgroups to foster problem-solving, thus reducing the need for assistance from TAs.

 

I share this information with you, my fellow students, and will respectfully forward it to our professors.""",

I think a clear answer on this question will benifit everyone in the class. @913 doesn't really have one so I'll try again here.

Produced image:

And here is the reference image:

Here are the two images side by side:

To my eyes, they look exactly the same. But it says that the two images are different.

Now I, along with the poster for @913 believe that this is due to rounding errors that are caused by different implementations. I personally use python's provided function round(x). I also tried np.around(x) which also returns a false result.

So what I am asking is do we absolutely need to have the reference image match the produced image exactly. If so, how should we get around doing this?

    """Image differences
As is understandable there have been lots of questions of the form "my image looks the same as the reference but doesn't match exactly, is that OK?" First, if you are at that phase, finish the rest of the assignment before worrying about the subtle differences!

But after that, I wanted to post some principles for what I think counts as close enough. Exact equality between your images and the reference images is not a requirement, since differences in rounding errors can cause code that is equivalent under exact arithmetic to produce slightly different results. However, some things can be actually wrong that lead to differences in images that are not that obvious. So we’ll use these principles in grading:

If the images look identical side by side, any difference will lead at most to small point penalties
If there are systematic errors (e.g. global half-pixel shifts due to an error in how rounding is done, rather than a difference in unavoidable rounding errors in the calculation) we might take off a tiny bit even for images that are not distinguishable side by side. (These kinds of things are best noticed by flipping back and forth between images, rather than comparing side by side where small shifts and distortions can’t be seen.)
Absolute differences of 1 in the 8-bit pixels are not relevant.
values read from outside the image can be whatever you want; we have been a little inconsistent in our specs so it's fine to return black or clamp to the edge or any other reasonable option.
[Updated] Pixel values outside the bounds in the warping problems will be ignored.
I encourage you to think of the small details as important, but not to spend your whole week obsessing about them!""",

    """Helper Code for Practicum Drawing Project
Hey Everyone,
Some of you expressed concern in our meetings about:
- the timeline for project 1
- where to start with the code

- how to work in parallel on aspects of the project
- if you could work off of a reference solution to A2

I felt a lot of these concerns could be best addressed with a new Repo for this project, which you can now find here:

The code looks very much like a completed version of A2 with much of its functionality refactored into AniGraph and with added features to make building and switching between different custom view classes easier. There may be a small number of students who could still hand in A2, so we are relying on the honor system when it comes to solutions that are in this code.

Notably, for practicum, I've added the following classes:

- `ExampleExplicitParticleElement`: a simple particle SVG element class

- `ExampleExplicitParticleView`: A simple view class that uses `ExampleExplicitParticleElement` to build a basic but functional single-element explicit particle system. This class also shows how you can specify custom GUI controls for different custom particle system effects (views).

- `CustomViewsComponent`: A component where you can specify additional custom view classes that will become selectable from a dropdown menu in the GUI. This should make it much easier to work in parallel on different features/effects.

This code should offer a pretty significant head start on the assignment. You do not have to use it, but it will probably make things a lot easier for most of you. If you were worried about the timeline for the project, I definitely encourage you to use this code. If you weren't, it may still help you focus more of your efforts on cool effects and less on debugging javascript and GUI features. 


I will still put out a video version of the notes I released earlier, but I thought this would make a bigger difference in helping you get momentum on the project. I'll also add some notes to the video on how to navigate the helper code.

Best,

The reason why I am weighing my options is because I spend almost 20 hours completing these assignments or going to office hours (where I will be stuck on the queue waiting and perhaps not get called by the end of two hours), which are due on a weekly basis. I know this is not the case for everyone, so I'm hoping I can start a conversation on how I can spend less time on these assignments.

When will grades be released for assignment 1 or 2? I understand that we just submitted assignment 2, but is it possible to see how we did on assignment 1?
Is there a way to record office hours or make general videos about common assignment questions? I understand the TAs and the course staff are doing their best to accommodate, and I do appreciate all of their efforts. They have helped me understand assignments much better, but I find it time-consuming to have to wait in office hours, where all the students have code-specific questions, and not end up getting seen by a TA. I was new to python, so much of the numpy functions were not as clear to me, even after working on the numpy tutorial provided for this assignment.
Will this class be curved? In any sense of the word? Where will the median of this class be anchored? Since we are doing all of this online due to the pandemic, will the curve be different or higher because of this? More specifically, when we get our A1 assignments, could there be some grading guidelines posted as to what letter grade our grade on the assignment will correspond to? Are all these assignments weighted equally, or is heavier weight given to assignments later in the semester?
For anyone who has not been struggling with these weekly assignments, are there some resources I could be using? I have been watching the lecture videos and yet I still can't find crucial implementation details that take me hours to figure out until I ask here on Piazza. Thank you to those who have been answering questions on Piazza in a timely manner!

    """Project Updates / Slip Day Policy
Hey Everyone,

A couple of practicum updates:

First, we've decided to allow for three slip days total for all practicum projects combined. Be wary that working in groups may complicate this if you anticipate changing groups for future projects, though.

Second, after discussing with Steve, we decided to offer simpler options for completing the second topic requirements (collision detection or IK).  Our motive in this is that we would rather you spend time exploring variations and creative ideas using whatever you implement than spending all of your time debugging a more advanced feature (of course, if you are able to implement the more advanced feature and also explore creative demonstrations of it, that's even more impressive).

The simpler strategy for collision detection is the first method I describe in the video I posted earlier tonight. The idea is that you test particles against the edges of a shape using a point-line segment test. I provided an example view (in NearestPointView.js) that should help with debugging this approach. Refer to the video for more details.

The simpler option for inverse kinematics is to just implement the 2-node version I demonstrated in an earlier video. 

Note that in both cases---collision detection and IK---implementing the simpler versions above puts you in a good position to implement more advanced approaches as well (e.g., swept volume collision detection or n-node IK). We're simply saying that we would rather you demonstrate something creative with less functionality than spend all of your time debugging extra features and not really getting to show them off.

Again, please reach out with questions or features requests---e.g., some of the features I added to the repo tonight were in response to student requests.

Good luck, and I look forward to seeing what you are all up to!""",

It was mentioned that we should instead use the inverse of the transpose of the object-to-eye-space matrix.

On that page, I found this code for a lambertian shading vertex shader:

I noticed that they simply multiplied the vertex normals by the object-to-eye-space matrix.

Presumably, most games that have optional raytracing use rasterization by default.

From my understanding of the two systems, though, aren't they not really drop in replacements? Can you really just toggle something and have your whole game use raytracing instead of rasterization? Because then, if I understand correctly, wouldn't you be foregoing the entire graphics pipeline and using raytracing instead, meaning a lot of your visuals would be affected and would have to be reprogrammed?

There have been a lot of questions about grading weights and late policies so we put our heads together and nailed down the details. Here they are:

Grading is 20% quizzes and 80% assignments; assignments are equally weighted.
Each assignment has a specified part and a creative part; the weighting between these is variable per assignment and is 70/30 (70 for the specified part) for A1.

The specified parts will be graded primarily automatically. The creative parts will be graded holistically based on a demo you submit (sorry we were planning synchronous demos originally but it's just not going to scale). There are three thresholds here: (a) implemented something that fits the requirements and works correctly but displays little creativity (e.g. reproducing one of the given examples); (b) did the same but displayed creativity (came up with something interesting that is different from the examples); (c) built something cool that really goes above and beyond. In a traditional 100-point scale, (a) would map to 90, (b) would map to mid-90s, and (c) will result in us noting the exceptional work. Exceptional work will be considered at the end of the semester to compensate for some deficiencies in other assignments in deciding borderline grades, and is the only way we might award A+s.

To provide you some schedule flexibility we are using slip days. You have 9 slip days for the 9 assignments, and can use at most 3 on any one assignment. So turn them all in 1 day late, or turn in half of them 2 days late, etc. Slip day accounting will be done by CMS.""",
