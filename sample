Class Algorithm vs. Cluster Group
The instructions read, "

Class Algorithm
The k-means algorithm needs to work with several clusters at once. Hence it does not make sense to put this code in the Cluster class. Instead, we put this code in a separate class called Algorithm. The data stored in this class is simple: a list of all clusters in the algorithm, and as with Cluster, a reference back to the dataset.

_dataset: The dataset we are clustering
_clusters: The list of current clusters S1,‚Ä¶,SkS1,‚Ä¶,Sk
Once again, we have getters and setters for these attributes. But the important methods of class ClusterGroup are the core of the k-means algorithm.

A method to partition the dataset, implementing step 2 of the algorithm (_partition)
A helper method for _partition to find the nearest cluster to a point (_nearest)
A method to update all the cluster centroids, implementing step 3 (_update)."

Windows PowerShell Error
I have a strange problem.

I successfully installed python 64-bit on Windows 10 and was able to run helloApp.py. However, I can only use python from the anaconda prompt that appeared in my start menu after installation. Windows PowerShell gives me an error for typing python.

Error:

I did edit the path by selecting both options.

Edit: You are going to hate me, but I am working off a desktop :( - any other ideas? I have the same error if I install 32 or 64 bit. Also, I installed python once before, but I uninstalled it before installing anaconda per instructions.

Edit: The problem is fixed, Seunghyun Kim is amazing. The PATH was incorrect for some reason. Probably an incorrect uninstall on the 1st version of Python I had.

Tomorrow's colloquium! (11:40am, G01 Gates ‚Äì Mentors Lecture Hall)
Noah Stephens-Davidowtiz

Title: Foundations of Lattice-Based Cryptography

Abstract:
There has been a recent revolution in cryptography due to the introduction of lattice-based constructions. These are cryptographic schemes whose security relies on the presumed hardness of certain computational problems over ubiquitous (and beautiful) geometric objects called lattices. Their many applications (e.g., fully homomorphic encryption) and security against adversaries with quantum computers has created some urgency to deploy lattice-based schemes widely over the next few years. For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is in the process of standardizing lattice-based cryptography, and Google has already implemented such a scheme in its Canary browser.

The security of the proposed schemes relies crucially on the assumption that our current best algorithms (both classical and quantum) for the relevant computational lattice problems cannot be improved by even a relatively small amount. I will discuss the state of the art in the study of this assumption. In particular, I will describe the fastest known algorithms for these problems (and potential directions to improve them) as well as a recent series of hardness results that use the tools of fine-grained complexity to provide strong evidence for the security of lattice-based cryptography.

Bio:
Noah Stephens-Davidowitz is the Microsoft Research Fellow at the Simons Institute in Berkeley. He has also been a postdoctoral researcher at MIT, Princeton, and the Institute for Advanced Study. He received his PhD from NYU, where his dissertation won the Dean‚Äôs Outstanding Dissertation Award in the sciences.

Much of Noah‚Äôs research uses the tools of theoretical computer science to answer fundamental questions about the security of widely deployed real-world cryptography, particularly post-quantum lattice-based cryptography. He is also interested more broadly in theoretical computer science, cryptography, and geometry.

With the release of A3 grades, I just realized that the bonus oreo problem could not make you cross the maximum. I now know this was mentioned in the README for A3.

Since the autograder comes very close to telling us how much credit we will get on parts 1 and 2, is such a policy going to be applied to A4 part 3? It is a non-trivial amount of work so I would like to know if I'd get a meaningful score boost if I did it. Thank you!

Initial state of page table
This is more of a test of my own understanding than a question that I'm hoping someone can confirm

1.) When a process is created room is allocated for the entire page table of size 2^p where p is the number of bit specifying the page

2.)Assuming the pg table is allocated right away, is it correct to say that only some of the entries are actually meaningful as not much physical memory needs to be allocated yet for this brand new process. As time goes on and the memory demand grows the process might try to touch an address that it has not yet mapped. This would be known by the valid/invalid bit which was set at the time of process creation and an exception could be generated if invalid where the OS creates the mapping and allows the process to continue.

Ino->size to be discovered very small
A previous post said "size" is the number of bytes, however I found this argument confusing.

In read_files, when I tried to do print out the size of the inode (ino->size), it said 4, which is very small if you take into account of the block size of 512 bytes. Does that mean ino->size is actually saying the number of blocks the inode is taking or it is just an inode taking 4 bytes of information?

Concurrency lock implementation

I've got a couple of questions regarding this two slides:
1) What purpose does the "suspend" function perform? Apart from the spinlocks, it looks just like the yield() function we saw in the lecture on Jan 30. So is it supposed to be "suspending" the current process and letting another process run?
2) I understand the need to do spinlock.release() for the else-clause of lock.acquire(), but suppose the program ran and it went to the if-clause instead. Calling suspend() will have released the spinlock (with lock->release()) already, so is there a need to call spinlock.release() in lock.acquire() again at the end? (Okay this is answered in @265 so I am good)
3) I think this applies to things taught in previous lectures too but I am curious as to why exactly do we need to explicitly modify the state to WAITING/RUNNING? Like I understand the concept of the process lifecycle but I don't see why is there a need to specifically call next->state = RUNNING or current->state = WAITING since the state attribute don't seem to be used anywhere else (like as a branch condition etc.) from what I see.
4) Why does suspend() need to have the disable/enable interrupts and spinlock acquire/release? Since suspend() is called from lock.acquire() which already has those won't that already prevent another thread from running whatever's in suspend() simultaneously?

Non interfering vs non blocking and mutually exclusive
We spent a lot of time in class today ensuring that two threads were non interfering. Would it be possible to have two threads that are non blocking and mutually exclusive, but are interfering on the invariant that is true when one enters the critical section? If so would that still be a reasonable synchronization mechanism or is it essential that all 3 properties hold?

In terms of an analogy if a doorman guarantees that only one person is in a room at a time, and that every person that wants to be in the room will get a chance, but tells you a load of BS before you go in can you still consider him to be a good doorman? (Supposing you know that you can't trust anything he told you)

Two stack pointers
If interrupt is its own program, then this slide is essentially saying it gets two stack pointers, one for user mode and one for kernel mode. In the slides, it seems like the interrupt uses only one stack pointer that points to the interrupt stack... for clarification, this is the kernel mode stack pointer? And is the user mode stack pointer (for the interrupt process, not the original process) ever used during the interrupt?

Converting from blockid_ to char
I'm having trouble correctly converting a blockid_t to char and vice versa.  When I do blockid_t to char, the blockid will be 228 and I think my alloc_block is correct.  But when I convert it to a char it's -28 in the char buffer when I read it out as an int it's also -28 and then it's is being converted to 4294967281 for an unsigned int.  Does anyone have any suggestions for converting blockid_t --> char? I've read a lot of the existing posts about this topic but I'm still confused.

Questions for Efficient Multithreaded Programming
My understanding is that the problem with broadcasting is that it can wake up threads that will never run due to the state of the program when the broadcast is made, and could therefore be inefficient. While important, this understanding doesn't fully address some core bits of knowledge needed for written efficient multithreaded programs. Here are some questions that for which I think answers would be really helpful for the current project.  It seems like the relative weights of the costs in 1-3 and the cost in 4 should determine a lot about the characteristics of a good program:

What is the cost of broadcasting to a condition variable waited on by zero threads?
What is the cost of signaling a condition variable waited on by zero threads?
What is the cost of signaling a condition variable even when doing so will not allow the intended thread to run?
What is the cost of doing logic with shared variables to figure out what condition variables, if any, to signal or broadcast to‚Äîboth in terms of what the processor must do and the code's complexity?
Thanks!

Interrupt safe use of locks
I am confused on how any of our code with locks is interrupt safe. Say I acquire a lock and am in the middle of a critical section and get interrupted. Then when I am about to get a chance to run again I handle a signal that was sent while I was gone. In handling that signal I try to acquire the lock that I already have, and then get put on the queue for the lock that I myself have. Deadlock.

Also, I see that in acquiring the lock that part is interrupt safe because of the disable/enable. But, if right after acquiring the lock we just use it in a non interrupt safe way why even bother with the enable/disable in lock acquire in a multiprocessor with test and set (other than performance for the spin lock to get used as quickly as possible). Also after doing some reading online it seems that on multiprocessors with test and set you don't need to enable and disable for lock acquire, but its just done for performance.

I'm assuming that I am making a mistake somewhere here, but I don't know what?

 New project A4 released
Dear all,

please find below a link that will take you to the Github repo for A4.

https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/yz2327/A4

This is the project that takes the place of Prelim 2 and is weighted the same as Prelim 2 previously was  (namely 30% of the total grade) .

As I mentioned in responding to your questions in  @782, you have the option of counting for your credit any two of the following three : Prelim 1, A4, and the final.

The project will give you some experience in manipulating inodes,  the persistent data structures that the file systems keeps for each file it stores.

We are going to begin discussing file systems this week in class, but we want you to get started on this right away.  To get you going, Yunhao has (amazingly!) prepared a YouTube video that contains, we believe, all you need to attack the project starting tomorrow. You can find the video here:

https://youtu.be/EO7nBmw-Scc

and on Canvas under the Module "Intro to A4", which you should be able to reach from this link:

https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/11544/pages/a4-tutorial?module_item_id=435490

You can also find a pointer to it in the handout for the project you‚Äôll find in the repo.

Office Hours

Every project increases the request for office hours. Besides, this is a new  project: we have worked very hard to work out all the kinks, but we have been, so to speak, building the car while driving it: most TAs will be doing the project just a few hours before you.

So, let‚Äôs talk about office hours.

I heard from some of you that some office hours have been busy, to the point that you have not been able to get the help you were looking for.  I have discussed this with the teaching staff and we have been exchanging ideas on how to make things more efficient and give to as many students as possible a chance to ask at least one of their questions during office hours.

But, let‚Äôs face it: the medium is inefficient: it is yet another thing that we have to recognize and, all of us, learn to live with: from the teaching staff side, it means trying to find ways to optimize the interactions; from your side, it means adapting your behavior so that you can get, in these circumstances, the best possible help.

Which brings me to another thing that I have learned from my TAs: almost all their office hours leading to A3 were empty ‚Äî just tin the two/three days before the assignment was due there was a spike.

So, to recap:  1) you may need help; 2) office hours immediately before the deadline are unlikely to be able to absorb the load; 3) most office hours before the last bottleneck days are empty.

You are smart Cornell undergrads -- but here is a friendly hint ;-)

       start on your project NOW, and beat the rush.

And be done early: if you don‚Äôt  start thinking about it when the project is basically due and fall pray of the ‚Äúfog of war‚Äù, it is a project you can finish relatively quickly.

Due Date


The project is due May 14, at 11:59 pm  Ithaca Time

A public ‚ÄòThank you‚Äù

I have been touched by the dedication of the TAs in this class. Preparing a project from nothing takes hard work, and to do so while managing the challenging times we are in is truly spectacular. I realize that it is hard to be thankful to someone who has just created a new project for you to work on, but I hope you too appreciate their dedication.

The best way to repay them for the hard work is to get on with your project soon (today), and, while working at it, to remind yourself that the honor system we live by is a covenant of free people, who, free to be other than honorable, choose instead to be so.

Inverted page table hashing
I have a few questions about the inverted page table mechanism.

1.) Is there now just one global table for all processes that maps frames to virtual page numbers? Is this table contiguous in memory who's first entry location is designated by some register?

2.) Are the chains of individual hash entries disjoint? Meaning if VPN1 hashes to 5 which is occupied so instead it gets put in 25, could there be something else that originally hashes to 25 resulting in a collision even though VPN1 didn't belong in 25 in the first place. Leading to a mixing of the chains and increased search times. I don't see how this could be avoided given a contiguous table of fixed size as I am imagining.

'exec' behaviors
In the spec, it says: "exec cat exec.c   same as 'cat exec.c', but without forking, so the 'shall' is replaced with 'cat exec.c' and doesn't return". Does this mean the shall should terminate after `exec cat exec.c`?
Also, "exec > exec.out    this doesn't run anything, but redirects standard output to the file exec.out. Further commands that are executed now have their standard output redirected to file exec.out." Does this redirection include error messages and exit status (i.e. process 36889 terminated with status 1)?

First Faculty Candidate Colloquium at 11:40am, G01 Gates, 2/28
Title: The Principal-Agent Value Alignment Problem in Artificial Intelligence

Abstract:
Much of our success in artificial intelligence stems from the adoption of a simple paradigm: specify an objective or goal, and then use optimization algorithms to identify a behavior (or predictor) that optimally achieves this goal. This has been true since the early days of AI (e.g., search algorithms such as $A^*$ that aim to find the optimal path to a goal state), and this paradigm is common to AI, statistics, control theory, operations research, and economics. Loosely speaking, the field has evaluated the intelligence of an AI system by how efficiently and effectively it optimizes for _its_ objective. This talk will provide an overview of my thesis work, which proposes and explores the consequences of a simple, but consequential, shift in perspective: we should measure the intelligence of an AI system by its ability to optimize for _our_ objectives.

In an ideal world, these measurements would be the same -- all we have to do is write down the correct objective! This is easier said than done: misalignment between the behavior a system designer actually wants and the behavior incentivized by the reward or loss functions they specify is routine, it is commonly observed in a wide variety of practical applications, and fundamental, as a consequence of limited human cognitive capacity. This talk will build up a formal model of this value alignment problem as a cooperative human-robot interaction: an assistance game of partial information between a human principal and an autonomous agent. It will begin with a discussion of a simple instantiation of this game where the human designer takes one action, write down a proxy objective, and the robot attempts to optimize for the true objective by treating the observed proxy as evidence about the intended goal. Next, I will generalize this model to introduce Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning, a general and formal model of this assistance game, and discuss the design of efficient algorithms to solve it. The talk will conclude with a discussion of directions for further research including applications to content recommendation and home robotics, the development of reliable and robust design environments for AI objectives, and the theoretical study of AI regulation by society as a value alignment problem with multiple human principals.

Bio:
Dylan Hadfield-Menell is a final year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, advised by Anca Dragan, Pieter Abbeel, and Stuart Russell. His research focuses on the value alignment problem in artificial intelligence. His goal is to design algorithms that learn about and pursue the intended goal of their users, designers, and society in general. His recent work has focused on algorithms for human-robot interaction with unknown preferences and reliability engineering for learning systems. Before coming to UC Berkeley he received his Master's from MIT on integrated task and motion planning for long-horizon robot control. He is interested in work that bridges the gap between AI theory and practical applications like robotics and his research draws upon related work in psychology, economics, and law/policy.

what is the self.round_prefix variable in q03?
Can you explain the round_prefix variable in q03? I don't understand why is it multiplied by 100.

Also with outputs like -

"DeliveryGuy 1 is trying to refill coffee machine with unit 100"

"DeliveryGuy 1 is trying to refill coffee machine with unit 101"

I am not sure how to interpret this message.

Clarification points say:

- 1 unit of coffee beans makes 1 cup of espresso.

- Each shipment contains 1 unit of coffee beans

So why is it trying to fill with 100 units instead of filling just 1 unit of coffee beans when I run the program?

After reading the code more I think I am a little less confused. Did the original print statement meant to say this instead:

'DeliveryGuy 1 is trying to refill coffee machine with unit identifier 101'

Read and write large files
Just to check my understanding is correct. If we want to read the data from an inode whose size is larger than 512 bytes, do we just iterate through all the data pointers (in blocks) until we have read all the bytes in size? Similarly, if we want to write more than 512 bytes of data into an inode, do we iterate through every data pointer (in blocks) writing 512 bytes when possible (and also allocating new block ids when necessary)?

Daily Post: March 27
One of the mot enthusiastic supporters of Cornell's decision to send us working from home is our cat, Yoda.



You may get to know him more when I start teaching from home, since he really likes to have attention when he feels it would be most annoying for me to give it to him ;-), so I expect sooner or later he will parade in front of the camera.

He is 13 -- we  surprised our kids one weekend by driving to  the SPCA to pick him up. He was tiny, but with gigantic ears -- hence the name. Our family was split on cat vs dogs: two of us were for dogs (full disclosure: a dog was supposed to be my Ph.D. gift: it is still supposed to be my Ph.D. gift...); one for cats; one for "do we really have to?".

Yoda has conquered us all though, in part because at times he seems  to think he is a dog (like when he fetches---we used to play like that every day when he was younger), and in part because of his athleticism: prior to fetching the little toy we were throwing him, he would actually try to block it by jumping in mid air. That is how he earned his full name: Yoda Buffon Alvisi (the soccer fans among you should appreciate the middle name...)

Are your pets enjoying seeing you back home? We want pictures!

HW2 Question 1
Hi! I would like to clarify that I'm stating the given list appropriately in my response.

I would like to state my assumptions as follows:

Assume we are given a list of length 2n where indices 1..n are network B's ratings where the index corresponds to its time slot and where indices n+1..2n are network A's ratings where the ratings are sorted such that index n+1 contains the smallest rating and 2n contains the largest rating.

Would it be similar to state the same thing but network B's ratings are also in order from smallest rating to largest? (Because the index actually doesn't matter that much?)

Would this assumption be alright? If not, how can I reword to make it align with the prompt? Thank you!

P vs NP
I read @859 and the handout for section 4, but I'm still confused about P vs NP. My current understanding is that if something is P, then it would mean we can cover all possibilities and verify in polynomial time. NP would be covering all possibilities is at least nondeterministic polynomial, but if given a possible solution, we can verify this solution in polynomial time? Also, for proving NP do we have to show that searching for all solutions is at least nondeterministic polynomial? or just showing that given a witness, we can verify in polynomial time?

The question in the supplement regarding graders and homework problems is a form of matching problem. However, it's not one that is naturally solvable by Gale-Shaply. Gale-Shapley is used for matching people in group A to people in group B, where all members of group A and group B rank the members of the other group.

There is no concept of ranking in this problem. We just need to assign graders to problems in a way that satisfies those constraints. This problem is known as a network flow problem. No need to worry about this now, you'll learn all about them in about a month or so into this course. The basic idea, if you are curious now, is you encode the constraints into a graphical network and push "flow" along paths in the network from source to sink (see Ford-Fulkerson algorithm).

So you do not need to know the algorithm that solves this minimization problem yet. We gave you this example as an introduction to what a reduction is (see @46), where you take a word problem and translate it to a new problem solvable by a known algorithm. We are just asking you to understand the idea of creating this construction -- not applying any algorithm just yet.

q3 clarification
I feel like I am not understanding this problem correctly. The question straight up tells us that the submatrix domination problem is NP-complete. That means that it is NP-hard.

However, it seems like this problem just boils down to finding a mapping from elements in matrix A to elements in matrix B such that you are mapping to a number greater than or equal to what you are mapping from. In this case, for each element in A, can't we just create a mapping to the smallest element in B that is still greater than or equal to the element in A? In this case this would just be O(n^2) time which is polynomial. But that cannot be, because we are told that the submatrix domination problem is NP-hard. Could someone let me know where I am going wrong? Thanks.

So I have the pre-order and post-order correctly computed for the DFS, but I am confused about how to label the edges. Do we label the edges while we work through the DFS algorithm, or can we label edges using the pre and postorders of nodes after DFS is complete?

Proving NP-complete Clarification
If we want to prove a problem X is NP-complete, is the only thing we need to do is reduce a known NP-complete problem to X (along with the proof and complexity analysis)?

We don't need to first show that it is NP, right? Though I guess that's a bit redundant, since if it's NP-complete, it has to be NP

Question on Reductions and NP-completeness Notes
I was reading through the notes on Reductions and NP-Completeness. In the section "The Class NP", it talks about one-place predicates and two-place predicates in determining if a decision problem is P or NP. I think predicates are logical formulas, but I am having trouble understanding the difference between one-place and two place. Thanks for any help.

Q3 traversal order
I have questions on the traversal order of Q3.

In the handout, it's being said the search should be started from node 0, and "you must explore the edges (u, v) with source node u in
the order that they are given in the input".

So for example if the graph is

2->1->0

With input given as

3 2

2 1

1 0

The output should be 2 1 0 as the first line if we explore the edge by input. But doesn't this order counteract with the rule "the search should be started from node 0"? Vice versa.

Also if with the same graph, the input given is

3 2

1 0

2 1

How will the first line output be? because if traversing by the order of lines in input, the order will no longer be 2 1 0 although the same graph persists.

Any help will be appreciated!

Partner-finding social
Message from WICC:

Dear Professor Kozen,


Hi, my name is Anna and I‚Äôm the social co-director of Women in Computing at Cornell! This semester, we are holding a CIS Partner Finding Event for students to meet other people in their CIS classes to find friends or potential partners. Would it be possible for us to advertise our event in your class(es)?


The event will be held on 09/08 from 7:30-10:30PM EDT using the Glimpse platform. It will be split into class levels: 7:30-9:00PM for 1000 & 2000 level classes, and 9:00-10:30PM for 3000+ level classes. Students will need to RSVP to this form in order to receive the event link: . Below we have attached the event cover containing the necessary information. Please let us know if you have any questions or policies that we should take into account.


Thank you for your time!


Best,

Anna Nguyen

A few questions about CNFSAT and cliques
Hi, I have a couple of questions regarding these two problems.

First, what is the runtime of each?  I'm a bit confused because we said CNFSAT was only solvable exponentially but then we were able to get around that by a reduction.  Second of all, can we assume that (based on the algorithm we gave for the clique problem) that the solution to finding whether there is a k-clique can be slightly adapted to count how many k-cliques there are?

Thank you!

Okay to use HashMap for memoization?
Hi,

I was wondering if I could use hashmap for the memoization of Q1 from HW3, because I want to store the nodes mapped to their optimum values.  Because I want to do a post order traversal of the tree, is it also okay to have a recursive algorithm instead of the iterative examples in the book?  I do not know how to encode starting from the leaf nodes iteratively because the nodes are not easily stored in a "post order array" that I can then loop through in order.  would forming this post order array first recursively and then doing the actual solution algorithm iterativley be a better approach?

Thank you!

Intuition behind the "HP is undecidable" proof
During the 11/9 lecture we first proved HP is undecidable by assuming there is a machine K that decides HP, construct a machine N on top of K, and then getting a contradiction that "N accepts N iff N does not accept N". We then explained why it is called diagonalization by drawing a matrix and seeing that "HP is decidable"  will contradict the fact "there are finite number of TMs".

I understand that both processes prove the claim by contradiction, but have a hard time seeing how these two processes and their intuitions relate to each other since the two proofs give contradiction to different facts. Would appreciates some insights on their relation. Or are these two proofs simply different approaches and don't really relate?

Proving a problem is decidable
Hello,

In lecture, Professor Kozen said that (i) A is decidable if and only if both A and its complement are accepted by TMs, and said that we have to prove both directions of this.

In the notes handout, it says that (ii) a problem is decidable if there exists a total TM with L(M)=A.

For 2 on the hw when proving one is decidable, it is sufficient to just do (ii) and describe a total TM that solves the problem?  Would we have to prove anything about the TM?  Or, do we have to do the two directions of (i)?

Thank you

Neural Nets Error Confusion
Since we said that delta w is the error of a particular set of weights for an example, can the neural net learning update rule be written in the following way? Is this the same as the neural net learning rule we talked about in class (on the slides)?

I'm confused whether it's true that the error of a state is the sum of errors of its neighboring states. If so, could you please provide an explanation for why it is this way.

I'm also wondering what would happen in a neural net with cycles when calculating the result of the activation function. I'm guessing you wouldn't be able to get a value, since in a neural net with one cycle between two nodes, two variables are expressed in terms of each other in two equations.

As a result I will be computing your grade on HW1 both with and without question 5 and give you the higher of the two.  (Gradescope will show your grade including question 5.  We will be computing the max offline so you won't see it online.)

Quiz 3 Problem 4
For this question (specifically, the question on whether a beam search with a beam size equal to n is guaranteed to find a solution), I understand why the answer would be True, if a solution does exist. However, since the question does not explicitly specify that a solution indeed exists, wouldn't the answer technically be false? (In other words, if the given search space does not have a goal state, then wouldn't beam search fail to find a solution, even with a beam size equal to n?)

While taking the quiz, I noticed that the first question did ensure to make this distinction ("Hill climbing might fail to find a solution if one exists"), so I thought that the absence of this information in question 4 was significant. Am I misunderstanding something here?

academic integrity in difficult times
I'm not sure how widely this has been distributed, but the university released a new academic integrity statement in light of our reliance on online teaching and assessment this semester.  You can find it at link.

At some level you already know what it says.  You know when your behavior is admirable and when it is not.  My responsibility is to be clear about where the boundary is, much of which is already laid out on the original course website.  I will continue to do my best to do so as we move ahead.  For example, you may wonder if quizzes are open or closed book and notes.  I don't know yet, I still need to come up with some of the quiz questions that I plan to use before making that decision.  But either way I will let you know ASAP, before the quizzes start up, so that it's not a question for you.

I've thought a lot about how to manage academic integrity issues in our new course setting.  Talking about it solely in terms of rules and punishments avoids having to confront the underlying causes of academic dishonesty, so let me briefly turn to that.  Those who make college academic integrity a topic of their research have compiled list of common reasons for why students cheat.  Pressure to get high grades is one of them, and we have a lot of that here but we also have this semester's unique S/U policy, which is about diminishing that pressure. Another is parental pressures, which I also discussed in my earlier note.  Another is pressure to get a job, and I've also already discussed the neutral position of this semester's S/U grades on job search.  Another is a desire to excel, which is an admirable trait that you should maintain, but with an understanding that doing so through dishonesty isn't actually excelling it's cheating.  The other reasons they have identified for cheating?  Laziness, lack of responsibility, lack of character, poor self-image, a lack of pride in a job well done, and lack of personal integrity.  None of which I believe you will want to see when you later look into the mirror.

We are in a time of stress.  How we behave under stress reveals our character. This is both a statement about each of us individually - what we would want to see in the mirror when we look back at this time - and about our society and what values we believe it embodies.  It's also a statement of putting your trust in others, that they will similarly exhibit the best of behaviors.  If you find yourself in a situation where you are tempted to violate Cornell's academic community standards, don't.  Contact me about what in your life has made it difficult to keep up with the course within the behavioral expectations of being a Cornell student and let's see what we can do about it.  Notice that I didn't say come see me and tell me why you want to cheat, because what I'm seeking isn't just something to do when you feel like cheating.  Please let me if there are forces in your life that are making progress in the course in our current circumstances difficult for you.

Quiz 4 Practice Question 4

status check
As everyone no doubt has seen, Canvas now has "mock grades" for you based on your work this semester, together with what you might get if you perform at median for the rest of the semester if you're currently below that.  It's intended to help you understand how you're doing and what the S/U question might mean for you.

More generally, please use this as a chance to pause and reflect on how your semester is going.  Some students are facing relatively modest difficulties coping with what COVID-19 has thrown their way and others are facing massive challenges.  If elements of your life right now are intruding in your ability to perform as you'd have liked in CS 4700, if you haven't been in touch with me about it already please don't hesitate to do so.  You would not be the only person facing challenging times, and we can see what might make sense for 4700 given your situation.

Zoom changes on May 24 and 30
Just FYI:

On May 24 there's going to be a change to all Zoom lectures/meetings/seminars: All such meetings must have passwords, in addition to the usual authentication protocols.  This will not only apply to any new meetings in the future, but will also be applied retroactively. Thus I am told that I need to add passwords to all my past lectures (or else they will be added for me).  That shouldn't affect most students in CS 4700 since the class is pretty much done for students, but I'll nonetheless hold off until the date gets closer, in case the changeover has glitches and interferes with anyone wanting to refer back to the lectures.
On May 30 you will need to use Zoom version 5 or higher for lectures/meetings/seminars.   To update your copy launch Zoom, click on the profile picture at the top right, and click on Check for Updates.  Or wait until May 30 and Zoom will prompt you automatically.
They've also helpfully informed faculty that Zoom will be offering no support to individuals in May and June, so if you run into any problems you will need to seek help from Cornell IT people.

Monte Carlo Lecture Slide 18: Game Statistics in Tree Confusion
I was confused by the numbers in the tree during lecture today. Here is a picture:

In class we said that the white node selects 60/79 because that is the node where white wins the most (so taking the action at the grey node, white has won 60 times out of 79). But then, when we simulate the game and black wins, the grey nodes are updated (by adding 1) but not the white nodes. Why does this happen if the grey nodes are keeping track of the number of times white has won? Or if the grey nodes are keeping track of the number of times black has won, why would the white node select the node where black has won the most, minimizing white's chance of winning?

Slight differences between photos - step 2
Hi. There is a slight difference in our renders compared to the reference photos  at the end of step 2 that we can't figure out what the cause might be. In sphere_globe, it seems like the sphere is slightly moved and is not in the same position as the one in the references. (left one is our render - right one is the reference). 

Also in three_spheres_textured, there seems to be a large difference in the biggest sphere (mirror reflection probably) , but not in the smaller ones which is confusing for us to figure out why. 

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. thanks.

Image differences
As is understandable there have been lots of questions of the form "my image looks the same as the reference but doesn't match exactly, is that OK?" First, if you are at that phase, finish the rest of the assignment before worrying about the subtle differences!

But after that, I wanted to post some principles for what I think counts as close enough. Exact equality between your images and the reference images is not a requirement, since differences in rounding errors can cause code that is equivalent under exact arithmetic to produce slightly different results. However, some things can be actually wrong that lead to differences in images that are not that obvious. So we‚Äôll use these principles in grading:

If the images look identical side by side, any difference will lead at most to small point penalties
If there are systematic errors (e.g. global half-pixel shifts due to an error in how rounding is done, rather than a difference in unavoidable rounding errors in the calculation) we might take off a tiny bit even for images that are not distinguishable side by side. (These kinds of things are best noticed by flipping back and forth between images, rather than comparing side by side where small shifts and distortions can‚Äôt be seen.)
Absolute differences of 1 in the 8-bit pixels are not relevant.
values read from outside the image can be whatever you want; we have been a little inconsistent in our specs so it's fine to return black or clamp to the edge or any other reasonable option.
[Updated] Pixel values outside the bounds in the warping problems will be ignored.
I encourage you to think of the small details as important, but not to spend your whole week obsessing about them!

Small Difference in Shadow Shape / Edges?
UPDATE -- Prof Marschner's answer solved my problem!

The parts of the shadow that are farthest away from the viewer are flat in our implementation, but more rounded in the reference image (only a difference in a single row of pixels). Additionally, when zooming close in on the edges of spheres, there are some pixels that are background in our image but part of the sphere in the reference, and others vice versa.

I would assume this is due to some sort of rounding error when we are calculating intersections? However, all of our sphere intersection tests pass. Is there a different possible reason for this difference? Or is this small discrepancy acceptable?

Our image:

Reference:

I noticed from pictures on piazza that some groups seemed to have the rounded shadows matching the reference while others had the same "flatter" shadows like ours.

I have finished the codes in A1model and successfully passed all the tests provided by TA. However, when I actually play around with it in the browser, I find I cannot actually move/rotate the object or the origin just as demonstrated in the demo videoes by Prof. Davis.

I think this is pretty unnormal, just wondering is there anything i am missing here? or there might be something wrong with my implementation in A1 model? or i have to implement controllers to make the anchor/object draggable (but I don't think so after watching the videoes)?

Hello everyone! 

I just released an assignment on CMS where you will be able to see your groups and sign up for a time to meet with Professor Davis and a TA. This meeting will be 25 minutes or less and will be led mainly by you and your group telling us what you would like to add to A2 for your practicum project. Professor Davis will be releasing more detailed expectations of what we are looking for soon! 

Please select a time to meet by Monday at 11:59pm as that is when CMS will stop letting you schedule a time. 

If there are any issues with your groups, or you have any questions, please feel free to add a follow-up to this Piazza post.

Assignment 1 Deadline & Course Schedule Adjustments
Hi Everyone,
It has been an unusual and challenging start to the semester, and things have played out a bit differently than we expected:

Javascript is less familiar and more of a challenge for students than we anticipated.
Web development and GUI development seem to be new for most of the class
We have about 3x the number of students we expected
We want to do our best to make this class available for everyone who wants to take it. To that end, we‚Äôve taken a lot of your feedback into account and decided the following:

1) To help students with the adjustment to assignment 1

We are giving free slip days on assignment 1. This means that you can hand it in up until Friday, Sept 25 at 11:59pm at no penalty and no cost to slip days, but you must hand it in no later than that.
We are developing a way to run tests that simulate user interactions to help you debug controllers in javascript. We will release those as soon as they are ready (today or tomorrow) to help you check your code.
2) To give students a chance to learn more about how to debug web applications, and to give the staff a chance to develop more scalable strategies for future assignments, we will delay the release of Assignment 2 until the following Friday, October 2.

3) Future assignments will be done in groups to help promote more engagement within the class.

This means that next week there will be no assignment out, and we‚Äôll focus on helping you get more familiar with Javascript, establish your development environment, and learn debugging strategies that will help you with these assignments. We expect you to use this time to familiarize yourself with web development tools. After this, running your code in a working debugger will become a prerequisite for receiving code-specific help at office hours.

We know it‚Äôs a crazy semester and want you all to have a good experience in this class. Please continue to let us know if you find ways we can do this better. We will do our best to adapt and keep improving things.

Best,
-Abe & Steve

recenterAnchorInSubtree & getChildTreeObjectSpaceBoundingBox Tests
Hello Everyone, 

I wanted to let everyone know that the tests for recenterAnchorInSubtree & getChildTreeObjectSpaceBoundingBox are NOT good. Please do not rely on them to tell you the correctness of your code. If you look at the test file you can see why; some of the tests are just placeholders that always return true. (I didn't expect these placeholders to be released to students, so I'm sorry about this confusion!) 

The test cases for the first four functions should help you, but please ignore the results of any tests for those last two functions. In fact, I would just comment them out for now. 

Looking at your code in the GUI is much better to gauge the correctness of these two functions. When you create a group of children, does the bounding box correctly enclose all the objects in this group? Is the anchor in the center? If the answer is yes to both of these, then you have most likely correctly completed these two functions regardless of what the tests say.

Creating a variable number of new shapes for Creative portion
For the creative portion, I plan to create mirrored shapes of the original that are arranged around the original shape in a specific way. I would also like to create a slider that adjusts the number of "mirror" objects created- be it 1, 10, or 50. However, I'm stuck on how to change the number of shapes if the slider is adjusted post-initialization. From the starter code, every shape is created in initGeometry, and then their values/vertices are changed in updateShapes- new shapes are never created or destroyed.

Is there a way to create new shapes and have them persist while running updateShapes? Alternatively, is it possible to call initGeometry again while inside updateShapes (if it detects that the variable for # of shapes has changed) to reinitialize the scene?

A3 Clarification Questions
Hi! I just had two clarification questions about assignment 3:

In @842 and the Distortion notebook, it says to use black for points that fall out of bounds when doing linear interpolation on the rotated image. However, the reference linear interpolation image seems to be using pixels at the border instead of black when calculating out-of-bounds values. Should we also be using the pixels at the border when doing linear interpolation, or should we leave them as black? The reference nearest-neighbor rotation image seems to use black for the out-of-bounds pixel values.
In the Filtering notebook, the spec for convolve_sep says that it takes in the 2d filter, and convolves the image using its separable filters. Are we supposed to be able to handle any separable filter f in this function, or can we assume it is the (square) output of gen_gaussian_filter? If we are supposed to be able to handle any separable filter, how are we supposed to be able to separate the filter in general before running the convolutions? I saw something online about using the SVD of f to separate it, but I wasn't sure if we were supposed to do that...
Thanks!

AttachToNewParent / RemoveFromParent Anchor Issue
My partner and I have been working on removeFromParent and attachToNewParent, and we're finding that things seem to be working as expected, except that when we attach an object to a new parent, the anchor of that object moves to the top left corner of the screen (which seems like (0,0) in world coordinates). Then when we remove it from the parent back to where it was before we attached it, the anchor returns to the middle of the object. Additionally, when we move the object when the anchor is in the top left corner, it flies around very crazily and does not move with the anchor (the anchor moves normally).

We are doing the exact same operations on both the matrix and the anchor/position in removeFromParent, and then the inverse of those operations in attachToNewParent. We're a little stuck as to where to go from here, since our logic seems to check out. Any guidance would be much appreciated!

How does "RTX ON" work?
Presumably, most games that have optional raytracing use rasterization by default.

From my understanding of the two systems, though, aren't they not really drop in replacements? Can you really just toggle something and have your whole game use raytracing instead of rasterization? Because then, if I understand correctly, wouldn't you be foregoing the entire graphics pipeline and using raytracing instead, meaning a lot of your visuals would be affected and would have to be reprogrammed? Or when you do "RTX ON", do only specific parts actually start using raytracing, and the rest of it is still the rasterization graphics pipeline? If so, what are those specific parts? And can you mix and match between the two systems that way?

Update on Assignment 1
Hey Everyone,

I wanted to give a quick update on Assignment 1. After some discussion, Steve and I decided to move the due date back to September 22.

Here were a few of our considerations:


- We want to give you time to get acquainted with Javascript and our codebase, and since this assignment is brand new, we realize that some parts will need clarification.

- We want you to take the creative portion of the assignment seriously---to think about the creative potential of writing custom views and to play around with that potential.

- We want you to put some care into how you demonstrate and describe your creative submission in a short video (see Assignment 1 module on canvas for details). Steve and I now know *very* well that this takes more time than most of us thought pre-pandemic. We can provide some guidance for those of you who don't know where to start.

Please don't read this message and think "that just means I'll start the assignment 1 four days later."

See you at section!

updateMatrixProperties scale and rotation
For updateMatrixProperties(), when I pass in

rotation = Math.PI * 135 / 180;

scale = new Vec2(-0.5, 0.5);
for one of tests, I get the angle as -45 and the scale as Vec2(0.5,-0.5). These two transformations will eventually transform the shape from world to object coordinate correctly, but I would fail the test case because the rotation is expected to be 135 degrees and scale = Vec2(-0.5,0.5). Would rotation = -45 degrees and scale = Vec2(0.5, -0.5) be an acceptable solution in this case?

Not sure if this is the right place for feedback, but I just wanted to express support for the lecture formats. I'm a big fan of the terminal windows being overlaid on Professor Marschner's lecture recordings. And Dr. Davis's level of enthusiasm keeps me highly engaged in his videos. Additionally, the concise format has kept my attention much more effectively than my other online classes.

TL;DR big praise for effective online teaching methods

white_balance spec clarification
I'd like to ask for some clarification on the spec for white_balance.

If we use the color channel scaling method specified in the lecture notes after black level subtraction, the range of values afterwards seems to be roughly [-10000, 67000]. Is it correct to interpret the comments to mean, "Clip this range to [0, 65535] and scale down to [0, 1]"?  I saw in @734 that the lower range should be clipped, but I'm unsure about the upper range.

Are solutions acceptable if they produce an output that looks correct? Part 2
I think a clear answer on this question will benifit everyone in the class. @913 doesn't really have one so I'll try again here.

A lot of the students including myself have a situation where the image that we produced looks like the reference image but the output says that the produced image and the reference image are different. Here is an example with rotation:

Produced image:

And here is the reference image:

Here are the two images side by side:

To my eyes, they look exactly the same. But it says that the two images are different.

Now I, along with the poster for @913 believe that this is due to rounding errors that are caused by different implementations. I personally use python's provided function round(x). I also tried np.around(x) which also returns a false result.

So what I am asking is do we absolutely need to have the reference image match the produced image exactly. If so, how should we get around doing this?

This doesn't happen to just rotate, it also happens for resolving a distortion and for shift left. Even though the images look equal, they aren't.

A2 Console Warning: "Did not know what to do for onModelUpdate for: parentUpdated"
Hi! I've pretty much completed A2Model and it mostly works as mentioned in the assignment writeup, except for a few weird edge cases.

I'm getting a weird console warning when I select a parented node (with the blue checkbox highlighted) and then I try to reparent it somewhere higher up in the tree (e.g. to the rootModel group). 



This console warning only happens if I select the parented node before trying to reparent it. If it is not selected with the blue checkbox, the warning does not appear. 

I also get the same console warning if I add a model to the window, selecting it with the blue checkbox, and then selecting the rootModel group with the blue checkbox, and then trying to rotate it with the slider. 

Any ideas what could be causing this? I see that the only thing in the stack trace that we were tasked with implementing is removeFromParent(), but even if I comment out my implementation and rerun, the warning still appears. 

Thanks!

Hash Functions
Just out of curiosity, I was wondering how hash functions are developed. The example in class hashed based on the first letter of the state, but surely to have truly effective hashing, the hash function must usually be much more complicated. Are there certain hash functions which are commonly used? How does one determine what a good hash function is?

(Presumably, however, if you are storing passwords or something secrative using hashing, you want some super complicated, super weird hash function, because if one knows the hash function, one can "decode" the passwords and get to them?)

Running GameState with run configurations
When I run GameState.java with the run configurations with a count greater than 1, every time it runs after the first time it fails to find the ring and produces the message in the console "Your solution to find returned at the wrong location". Additionally the first trial always works, it is only those after it that fail.

The Issue is that I can take that seed that appears to have failed and run it on its own in GUI.java and it's able to find the ring. I know this is not due to my solution taking too much time, as I often will still obtain a bonus over 1 on a seed that had failed. I have also tried increasing FIND_TIMEOUT in GameState.java but that has no effect. Could there just be some bug in my code that only comes through when I try to run multiple trials or is there some greater issue?

How does indexOf work?
Assuming that s1 is contained in s, when you use s.indexOf("test"), does java search the entire string, or only up until the first instance. 

In the case that it only searches up to the first index, could we then use indexOf again, except with a substring of the second half of s?

There once was a man named Gries
Who earned his doctorate overseas.

(That's a language whose syntax gave birth to C's.)

But these days "the Gries" teaches Java.
How that happened is quite a long saga.
  He's retired twice
  ---Wouldn't that be nice?---
He re-returned because teaching's his nirvana.

Our pairing is no coincidence
In fact it makes perfect sense:
  My alma mater, Miami,
  Gave him an honorary degree
Impressed by his 58 years of experience.

Inefficiency in Finding All Shortest Paths
My optimization of flee involves traversing through the nodes that hold coins by prioritizing the coin that is closest to Min's current location.

In order to do this, I have implemented a new version of the shortest path algorithm that returns a HashMap holding a shortest path to all nodes, as suggested in the handout.

I then call this method in DiverMin in the helper method getClosestCoin that returns the node with the coin currently closest to Min.

I have to call this method each time Min moves to that node to collect the closest and wants to look for a new coin.

This requires me to calculate all the shortest paths to all the nodes each time Min grabs a new coin, causing my algorithm to be inefficient and the runtime fairly slow (around 35-60 seconds for 100 maps).

How can I make my code more efficient?

An algorithm being non-deterministic
The subtractive method of finding the spanning tree is a non-deterministic method because we might end with different spanning tree diagram if we pick different edge to delete. Does it mean that whenever the result for some algorithm depends on the intermediate steps taken, then it's a non-deterministic algorithm?

Spring 16 7:30 Q2
For the call m("2"), why would it return an -1? The method call should encounter an Arithmetic exception because of division by 2-2, or 0. I don't see how it would end up in ArrayIndexOutofBounds? I don't think there is anything wrong with arrB[x+1], which would just be arrB[3], which is just 99?

Static fields
I'm currently reviewing static fields and am a little confused as to where the static fields are stored. Say in the example in lecture 4 [slide 21], field numObs is not located in the object. Where then is this field? Is there a separate class only folder that stores the static field numObs?

Thanks!

WidthAtDepth: stepwise refinement and appropriate recursive thoughts
INTRODUCTION
People who have trouble with widthAtDepth are probably thinking too much about how recursion works and

not about how we said to understand recursive functions or develop them. Secondly, too many people

are not using what we call stepwise refinement in developing these A4 methods. Were you taught stepwise

refinement in your first programming class? It's a pity if you were not. It is a fairly obvious methodology,

which was first explained in a paper by Niklaus Wirth in about 1972. Everyone sort of uses it,
but being more aware of what one is doing and using it consciously can be a big help.

 

We have three videos on stepwise refinement in the JavaHyperText ‚Äîlook in the top horizontal navigation bars.

We have two videos on recursion n trees. If you have not watched them, stop what you are doing and watch them!


Here, also, we try to get these ideas across to you using two examples and then discussing WidthAtDepth.
You should use the ideas expressed below in developing ALL you recursive methods.
Please read slowly and carefully.

AN EXAMPLE OF STEPWISE REFINEMENT

Suppose I ask you to write this method.

     /** Print the names of the children of t. */
     public void printChildren(BugTree t) { ... }

I do this in stepwise fashion by writing the method body like this:

     for (BugTree child : t.children) {
        Print the name of child
     }

I concentrated on getting the loop right, and to be able to focus on that, I wrote the loop body in English.
Now, I see how to implement the loop body. I end up with this:

     for (BugTree child : t.children) {
        // Print the name of child
        System.out.println(child.root.getName());
     }

I cannot emphasize too much this method of stepwise refinement, of doing one thing
at a time, writing all but what one is concentrating on in English. We may not need it
in this simple example, but in many cases, being methodical and careful like this will
lead you to a correct solution, and with much less trouble than simply hacking around.

 

A SECOND EXAMPLE OF STEPWISE REFINEMENT

Now consider writing the method below, assuming that we can't use children.size.

     /** Print the number of children of t. */
     public void printNumberOfChildren(BugTree t)

Since we can't use children.size, we have to write a loop to count the number of children.
So we write the following. Look! The loop body is in English. Get used to writing what the
loop body is supposed to do in English! Until you have more experience programming and
things go easier.

 

I did do one more step; I put in the line to print after the loop ended.

     int sum= 0;
     //invariant: sum contains the number of iterations executed so far.
     for (BugTree child : t.children) {
        // Add 1 to sum
    }
    System.out.println(sum);

Now we have to implement the loop body --put in sum= sum + 1; .

NOW ABOUT WIDTH AT DEPTH

 

Now consider writing this method.

   /** Return the width of this tree at depth d */
   public int widthAtDepth(int d)

There is a hint in the body:

       // If d > 0, the answer is: sum of widths of the children at depth d-1.

Read the line above carefully!
It gives you a recursive definition of width of the tree at depth d.
All you have to do is translate that definition into Java!
All you have to do is translate that definition into Java!

Once more, for emphasis: All you have to do is translate that definition into Java!

Now, use stepwise refinement to implement the recursive case, just as
we did in the two above examples. Write the loop body in English. Pay attention
to the similarity of this example with the second example above.

After you do that, you have to implement the loop body. Here is where recursion
come in. Do NOT think about how recursion works. That will only confuse you.
Instead: Compare what has to be done ---your English in the loop body---
with the specification of function widthAtDepth and write a recursive call.

It would be nice to get feedback in follow-up to see whether this helped.

Partition algorithm for Quicksort
Referring to variable names as in the lecture slide:

Q. Why, when b[j+1]>b[j], do we swap b[j+1] and b[t], why can't we simply do j=j+1 and continue forward? (I know we would need another loop which would increase complexity, I just don't understand why we are performing this swap, as in what exactly is it doing?)
