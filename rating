***KOCH SNOWFLAKE TURTLE VISIBILITY***
We set the visibility of the turtle to False at the end of the main snowflake function.

The Turtle only disappears in Speeds 1 through 10; the Turtle remains visible for Speed 0.

This wasn't the case for previous functions that used the Turtle and made it disappear, such as radiate() and draw_spiral()

It seems that Speed 0 is what's causing the Turtle to stay visible.

What can we do to fix this? Thank you

 Regarding the no makeup exam policy
It seems that the policy to offer no makeup exams is inherently unfair to students with an exam conflict -- they only receive two opportunities to score well on the exams; everyone else gets 3. We can expect that the latter group will obtain higher overall grades on average.

If a student does not want to attend an exam and chooses to let it be dropped, that is their prerogative. But this is not an option at all for people with conflicts.

Moreover, some students have conflicts for more than one exam and, under the current policy, are likely to fail (or receive a very poor grade in) the course. As this course is required for the CS major, failure is not an option they can afford (and would prevent graduation for students in their final semester).

There are roughly 20 and 10 courses with the same respective exam dates as Prelim 1 and Prelim 2. There are 77 courses with the same final exam date and time as this course.

Several other large courses in the CS department (such as 1110 w/ ~500 students and 3110 w/ ~400 students) indeed offer make-up exams. Since there are 19 TAs for this class, it should not be difficult at all to proctor one or more make-ups per exam.

By University Faculty (Office of the Dean) policy: "Faculty members are urged to accommodate students’ requests for alternative exam times or make-up examinations when students’ exam schedules are sufficiently congested to warrant such accommodation. For example, a student facing a direct conflict or three or more examinations during one twenty-four hour time period merits such accommodation."

As another student mentioned, in the section about prelims: "If a student has conflicting examination schedules, both of which are on the schedule developed at the annual evening prelim scheduling meeting or both of which are not on the schedule, the instructors of the courses involved must consult and agree on how to resolve the conflict. Both instructors must approach this resolution process with a willingness to provide an alternative or early examination."

The Cornell University Registrar adds that the onus to provide a make-up exam is on a course "if [it] is the largest involved". This is likely the case for this course.

Respectfully, exam and university conflicts are typically out of students' control. (Other classes are important and required too.) Therefore, it would be reasonable and proper for make-up examinations to be offered. Please kindly give appropriate consideration again to the policy.

Maybe. It's hard to tell without knowing what your code looks like (and that should only be shared with the course staff).

You should first verify that your Part 1 is correct. The part 1 autograder isn't perfect (this may be a feature, not a bug), so here's what I tried:

Replace any code you wrote in Part 2 to use a pthread_mutex_t such that you lock the entire inode when a single reader or a single writer enters, and don't unlock until that single reader or writer is done. Confused about what I mean by pthread_mutex_t? Have a look at this site that explains how
Run the Part 1 tester for good measure.
Run the Part 2 tester a few times. If you get anything other than a 10/10 (0/10, 5/10, segfault, etc), there's something wrong in your Part 1. Fix that before testing your real Part 2 implementation.
You should know that the Part 2 tester does use indirect blocks a lot, so if you are running into problems, I'd be super vigilant about thoroughly testing / debugging specifically the indirect block mechanism.

Tomorrow's colloquium! (11:40am, G01 Gates – Mentors Lecture Hall)
Noah Stephens-Davidowtiz

Title: Foundations of Lattice-Based Cryptography

Abstract:
There has been a recent revolution in cryptography due to the introduction of lattice-based constructions. These are cryptographic schemes whose security relies on the presumed hardness of certain computational problems over ubiquitous (and beautiful) geometric objects called lattices. Their many applications (e.g., fully homomorphic encryption) and security against adversaries with quantum computers has created some urgency to deploy lattice-based schemes widely over the next few years. For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is in the process of standardizing lattice-based cryptography, and Google has already implemented such a scheme in its Canary browser.

The security of the proposed schemes relies crucially on the assumption that our current best algorithms (both classical and quantum) for the relevant computational lattice problems cannot be improved by even a relatively small amount. I will discuss the state of the art in the study of this assumption. In particular, I will describe the fastest known algorithms for these problems (and potential directions to improve them) as well as a recent series of hardness results that use the tools of fine-grained complexity to provide strong evidence for the security of lattice-based cryptography.

Bio:
Noah Stephens-Davidowitz is the Microsoft Research Fellow at the Simons Institute in Berkeley. He has also been a postdoctoral researcher at MIT, Princeton, and the Institute for Advanced Study. He received his PhD from NYU, where his dissertation won the Dean’s Outstanding Dissertation Award in the sciences.

Much of Noah’s research uses the tools of theoretical computer science to answer fundamental questions about the security of widely deployed real-world cryptography, particularly post-quantum lattice-based cryptography. He is also interested more broadly in theoretical computer science, cryptography, and geometry.

Daily Post: March 25
Dear all,

I hope this finds you very well! I hope that the reason most of you are not sharing your favorite dishes with the rest of us is because your are busy eating them... though perhaps it's for the best. The posts you did send were awesome, and made it difficult for me to not run to the kitchen.

Anyway, I told you that today I would share my favorite dish. It is a difficult choice, as Bologna, the city i am from, is famous *among Italians* for being the nation's food capital.  Should I go for tagliatelle, egg-based past ribbons, in the glorious gold of eggs' yolk or the green of spinach, with a bolognese sauce or  with prosciutto?

Tagliatelle Bologna - Tagliatelle al ragù - Trattoria Annamaria

Or should I go with Lasagne Verdi, my daughters' favorite dish, and the *real* lasagne, with neither ricotta nor tomato sauce? More about it here:



But no--there could only be one choice: tortellini. After all, it is not every dish that has its recipe registered in city hall ( [in Italian] and its shape, according to legend, due to an innleeper who got a glance of Venus (long story) and tried to reproduce her navel in a ribbon of pasta (would that be the first thing that would come to your mind?)

Tortellini are *NOT* the abomination with cheese inside that you see served in a *gulp* salad---perhaps, with a pesto sauce. I am not sure how you'd feel about seeing someone putting ketchup on your favorite apple pie and claiming that it's wholesome American food... [By the way, the day I started here as a Ph.D. student, just off the plane, the Department had a nice welcome  reception at the Johnson Museum, where they served... you guessed it ;-) )

Every family has its own recipe--and holds on to it. Yes, there is the official recipe you saw above, but each family believes they know better! I would give you mine, but then I'd have to kill you...

Anyway, this is what we have at Christmas. Christmas Vigil is spent together, singing, chatting, eating munchies, and folding tortellini: here you see us at work (and the results). It is a wonderful time.

From time to time, I actually have all my graduate students over---we spend the afternoon making tortellini and eat them around a long long table in the evening...

  Stay safe, and stay in touch!

FA19 Q3


I don't understand why E is safe and F is not.

My understanding is as follows:

Looking at E,

disable interrupts is called before trying to acquire the lock.

If we disable interrupts, and then fail to acquire the lock, then that thread is just deadlocked. We'll be stuck at the acquire_lock() line, but we won't hear from any other threads because interrupts are disabled.

Thus to me, F seems like the right choice.

Hi! I am a little confused on write_file and read_file, and am not sure how to access a certain amount of bytes from buf. 

I think this is just my lack of C knowledge, I understand that we should be using memcpy but am not sure how to access say 512 bytes into buf.

part2_tester guidance
I am currently trying to figure out what could be wrong in my code for part2. I have a 40/40 for part1 and am getting the message "error get, not consistent with put large file" at line 60 which should suggest that it is my part2 is problematic according to @846.

To verify this, I implemented a simple mutex lock in place of a reader/writer lock as suggested in @888_f1. However, when I do this, part2 still errors (still at line 60) which seems to me that it is actually my part1 that is wrong.

To explore this further, I changed LARGE_FILE_SIZE and N_READ_WRITE_TEST to various smaller values (e.g. LARGE_FILE_SIZE > BLOCK_SIZE*8; 5 < N_READ_WRITE_TEST < 1000). I found that changing these values impacts whether I get 0, 5, or 10/10 (i.e. whether I fail in fixed size file test, varied size file test, or neither). However, I do not understand what this implies. With the original numbers, the error occurs in fixed size file test.

When part2 errors, I print out the str1 and str2 and find that they are completely different with no overlap. I have accounted for freeing blocks when the size of the written file is smaller than the previous file.

Is it possible to get some guidance for which part of my read/write file could be wrong? I cannot seem to pinpoint what could be causing these issues. Thank you in advance!

CS students entering assert statements
I am trying to figure out where to put assert statements to check that the condition "A CS student will not be allowed to take a enter if - after doing so - more than 60% of the people in the Career Fair are CS majors." I am having trouble on where to put assert statements to ensure this invariant holds. Does this invariant need to hold every time cs_student_enter is called (so I would put the assert statement right after I get the lock), every time cs_student_enter finishes (so I would put the assert statement right before I release the lock, after I have let the CS student in), or both?

Also, I am assuming I only need to check the invariant in the method cs_student_enter, but please correct me if I'm wrong.

Note: part2_tester can take a few seconds to terminate. However, if part2_tester runs for too long, it is likely because of a deadlock in your implementation.

Fall 2018 Prelim Question 1 T/F
Hi,

I have a question about the 10th T/F question from the fall 2018 prelim. It reads "Multi-level Queue Scheduling can sometimes lead to starvation." The answer is true. However, I remember from the multilevel feedback queue lecture that after some time the jobs at the lowest level are promoted to the highest level. I would assume this prevents starvation as all jobs at the same level are treated in a round-robin fashion, and every job gets the opportunity to reach the highest level of the queue. Is this question not referencing a multilevel feedback queue? If not, how can we know that it is not by reading the question. It says multi-level queue, so I assumed multi-level feedback queue.

Thanks!

Indirect block format?
Just to clarify, is there a limit on the number of indirect blocks a file can have? More generally, can we think of a large file as an arbitrarily long linked list. The first "element" in the list is our block[9] array where the first 8 elements point to data blocks and the last points to an indirect block. That indirect block has 512/4=128 blockids, where 127 blockids point to data blocks and the last blockid points to yet another indirect block (if needed). This model would allow files to be arbitrarily large so long as there are enough blocks to accommodate. Or instead, do we consider all files in the autograder to fit with blocks[9] and one indirect block of 127 blockids?

Does disk operate separately from main memory and CPU
I've always been confused on whether the disk runs entirely on its own as a parallel entity to main memory and user/kernel processes on the CPU.

For example if disk wanted to rearrange some stuff would that be entirely isolated from any process running on the CPU, and neither the OS nor any user would be aware of it (not just in terms of an abstraction, but literally does the disk kind of just handle it on its own and process everything with internal software/hardware)

Obviously when doing I/O there needs to be some involvement of main memory and OS but it seems like just cleaning up the disk or recovering some data can be done entirely independently?

TM Handout 5(e)
Hi, I'm a little confused about example (e) regarding decision problems with Turing Machines on the handout. We're trying to determine if M moves its head more than 481 tape cells away from the left endmarker on an empty input. We claim that if M doesn't move more than 481 tape cells away, then M either halts or loops in a manner we can detect (because there is an upper bound on the number of configurations we can have). 

But then we conclude that if we exceed 482km^481 steps, then M has looped. I'm a little confused by the logic / conclusion drawn here -- if we exceed the upper bound, why do we conclude that M didn't move more than 481 tape cells away (due to looping)? Why can't we conclude that we might've exceeded the upper bound because we travelled more than 481 tape cells away from the left endmark? Thanks!

Partner-finding social
Message from WICC:

Dear Professor Kozen,


Hi, my name is Anna and I’m the social co-director of Women in Computing at Cornell! This semester, we are holding a CIS Partner Finding Event for students to meet other people in their CIS classes to find friends or potential partners. Would it be possible for us to advertise our event in your class(es)?


The event will be held on 09/08 from 7:30-10:30PM EDT using the Glimpse platform. It will be split into class levels: 7:30-9:00PM for 1000 & 2000 level classes, and 9:00-10:30PM for 3000+ level classes. Students will need to RSVP to this form in order to receive the event link: . Below we have attached the event cover containing the necessary information. Please let us know if you have any questions or policies that we should take into account.


Thank you for your time!


Best,

Anna Nguyen

A few questions about CNFSAT and cliques
Hi, I have a couple of questions regarding these two problems.

First, what is the runtime of each?  I'm a bit confused because we said CNFSAT was only solvable exponentially but then we were able to get around that by a reduction.  Second of all, can we assume that (based on the algorithm we gave for the clique problem) that the solution to finding whether there is a k-clique can be slightly adapted to count how many k-cliques there are?

Thank you!

For question 1, I created a graph of nodes and edges representing supply and demand. Since there are a set number of blood types, for the running time of our algorithm, should we generalize it to any number of blood types? Otherwise, wouldn't it just be constant time because there cannot be more than a certain number of nodes and edges due to the restrictions on blood types and the fact that there are only 8 blood types?

HW5 Q3 clarification please
On my understanding, the Submatrix Domination problem is finding two one-to-one mapping, 1-m1 -> 1-m2 and 1-n1 -> 1-n2, so that A[i, j] ≤ B[r(i), c(j)]. But I think this is down to the comparison between the max element of matrix A and B.

If max(A) > max(B), then there should not be a valid mapping since anyway max(A) cannot ≤ any element of B;

Conversely, if max(A) < max(B), suppose max(B) has the indices u, v, then we could map all of 1-m1 to u and all of 1-m2 to v and those are still one-to-one mapping.

Considering m1 m2 pair, or n1 n2 pair might not be equal, I guess the problem does not require a perfect matching.

I wonder where I think wrongly above.

Q3 traversal order
I have questions on the traversal order of Q3.

In the handout, it's being said the search should be started from node 0, and "you must explore the edges (u, v) with source node u in
the order that they are given in the input".

So for example if the graph is

2->1->0

With input given as

3 2

2 1

1 0

The output should be 2 1 0 as the first line if we explore the edge by input. But doesn't this order counteract with the rule "the search should be started from node 0"? Vice versa.

Also if with the same graph, the input given is

3 2

1 0

2 1

How will the first line output be? because if traversing by the order of lines in input, the order will no longer be 2 1 0 although the same graph persists.

Any help will be appreciated!

Max number of edges
I'm having trouble thinking about the worst case number of edges in the preorder graph of preferences. Theoretically there could be a directed edge to and from each node, correct? If that is the case, then I believe there could be n*(n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes, which would mean O(n+m) is really an O(n^2) operation for each preference list worst case. That doesn't seem right to me because the book says that constructing the quotient graph is linear, which is why I'm confused. Is my analysis incorrect for the max number of edges?

NP-complete, NP-hard, NP Definition
From lecture and a bit of researching online, NP stands for "non-deterministic polynomial time", and NP-complete problems, to my understanding, is basically a set of problems that cannot be solved in polynomial time (at least not with anything we have right now), and we reduce problems to other such problems to show they take a lot of time to solve. And, if we were to ever solve one, we could solve the others as well.

What is the difference between NP, NP-complete, and NP-hard? Will we go over this in lecture? The next few weeks of lectures will cover NP-complete, but not sure how it relates to NP and NP-hard. Also, is there anything else to keep in mind about NP-completeness besides that we can reduce a given problem to an NP-complete problem?

Quiz 9 1a
The 1a of quiz a put forward an example of an non-optimal Q-learning. I'm curious because textbook says Q-learning is always optimal: 

"Q-learning learns an optimal policy no matter which policy the agent is actually following (i.e., which action a it selects for any state s) as long as there is no bound on the number of times it tries an action in any state (i.e., it does not always do the same subset of actions in a state). Because it learns an optimal policy no matter which policy it is carrying out, it is called an off-policy method."

Can someone explain that for me? Thanks.

Exponential space in terms of depth
Question from the relevant problems for the quiz:

Let m be the depth of the tree.

When doing a DFS don't you need to keep track of the visited nodes so that you don't enter a cycle? When doing this your visited set might be all the nodes if the goal is the last one you hit. This would be exponential in size.

However the answer key says the opposite so I'm wondering where I am wrong.

Notation for questions 5E
In figuring out whether is satisfiable, I'm confused about what the symbol means. If I'm remembering right,  the symbol is like the if/then relationship, and can be evaluated in a particular interpretation, but I thought that the symbol was a statement about a relationship across all interpretations, sort of like ⊨? Only I thought that "satisfiability" was a question of whether there exists a particular interpretation where a given proposition evaluates to true, so how do we reason about satisfiability when the proposition is making a statement about the relationship of A and B across all interpretations? Or, is that question asking, can there be an interpretation satisfying A∨B given that the A→B relation doesn't necessarily hold across all interpretations?

HW5 1a
I'm confused about how to apply the notation taught in class to words. In class we learned that 



Where



i.e., the number of examples in class l where attribute j  has the value at index a.

But in the homework, we have a bunch of examples (sentences) with varying length. Are we treating the first word of a sentence as attribute x¯test,0? So, when we're looking for the probability of very | Politics in 1(a), where "very" occurred in the second position in the test sentence, are we looking for the number of times "very" occurred as the second word in an example sentence with the label Politics out of the total number of example sentences?  This happens zero times and would send our probability to 0, which makes me think I have the wrong idea. 

Alternatively, should we treat each word as its own example? So then we would be looking for the number of times "very" was in a sentence labelled with "Politics" out of the total number of words? The gives me a more reasonable number but it feels too different to what we learned in class.

MDP's - Placement of Reward Function
While comparing at the Bellman equation with the formula given for active reinforcement learning, I noticed that for active learning, the reward function is outside the summation computing the expected utility of neighboring states. I’m not sure if the placement of this reward function in the Bellman equation makes a difference in the computation of the expected utility/optimal policy of a state. From what I understand, the reward from s to s' is already known and doesn’t really need to be part of the expected utility calculation, and could be placed outside the summation (represented by the bottom equation).

It then gives me an error "A2DBoundingBoxView.js:32 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'dup' of undefined". As far as I can tell the only thing that could be causing this is maybe an issue with my removeFromParent or attachToNewParent functions, but they pass all the tests and work perfectly fine when I manually make shapes parents or children of each other.

A possible improvement for future office hour
Hi, all.
I noticed that TAs are trying hard to help as many people as possible during office hours, but the queue is just so long, and we all have some problems with homework.

I think it is a good idea to help each other while waiting for the TA's. However, it is also not convenient for TA's to create each breakout room for each topic, and their time is precious.
I believe this problem could be solved using a website called https://gather.town/. I went to a conference this year, and they used this for virtual social gathering, which is cool and pleasant.
You can control your avatar using the keyboard and walk around the virtual 2D scenario. Furthermore, when you are close to somebody else, you can stream videos and audios like zoom.

The cool part is that it provides private gatherings; we can have a large office with many large tables. When you put your avatar around the table, you can only video chat with other people sits on the same table.

For TAs, they only have to have a private 1-1 table to help the students in the queue.

When it comes to screen sharing, TAs can still use the zoom since the website did not provide screen-sharing methods.

Furthermore, for students who are waiting for help, they can group based on questions on themselves and help each other while saving lots of time. Also, when the office in a virtual environment is running, people can always login and communicate with each other.
The disadvantages might be we have to create a virtual environment, which might take some time.

Hopefully this will help!

How does "RTX ON" work?
Presumably, most games that have optional raytracing use rasterization by default.

From my understanding of the two systems, though, aren't they not really drop in replacements? Can you really just toggle something and have your whole game use raytracing instead of rasterization? Because then, if I understand correctly, wouldn't you be foregoing the entire graphics pipeline and using raytracing instead, meaning a lot of your visuals would be affected and would have to be reprogrammed? Or when you do "RTX ON", do only specific parts actually start using raytracing, and the rest of it is still the rasterization graphics pipeline? If so, what are those specific parts? And can you mix and match between the two systems that way?

Assignment 2 helper tests | short office hours right now
Hi Everyone,

As we mentioned in Section today, there are now some test cases in the A2 repo to help you with debugging. Again, these are meant to hopefully help you, but they are not exhaustive. Also, if you believe your code is functioning properly despite failed tests we can perform additional checks.

Some of you mentioned that you had problems with the new creative portion helper code. I was unable to reproduce the problems as described in a clean version of the repo, but I have about half an hour of time right now if anyone is available to go over the issue in zoom:

Trouble understanding renormalize vertices

Is this correct? Or does the method do something else?

Random produces little blobs
I implemented setVertices, getVertices, and renormalizeVertices. From what I can see, it looks like my scaling and translation is working correctly in renormalize, and my updated matrix correctly maps the renormalized vertices back into world coordinates. However, when I place random objects on the screen, they show up as tiny barely visible blobs in the lower right corner. Adding objects by toggling the new command also isn't quite working. I'm wondering if there's some aspect I'm missing? Or maybe if one of the prior functions has an error it would reflect it in that way? Any advice would be much appreciated!

A3 Notes and Updates
We've updated the rotation reference image being used in the distortion notebook, as well as the small convolution reference image in the filter notebook.
For rotation using nearest neighbor, please put in black for points out of bound (we've updated the specs as well). Simlarly, when doing bilinear interpolation, if one (or more) of the 4 pixels used for the interpolation calculation fall out of bounds, use 0 for that pixel when doing the calculation. For example, if 2 of the 4 pixels used for interpolation fall out of bounds, use 0 for the values of those 2 pixels in the interpolation calculation.
Added tips on how to compare images (e.g. your implementation with the reference) in the tutorial notebook.
@853: In the undistort function, the input M maps distorted coordinates to image coordinates(as per the code comment). The write-up is updated to make it less ambiguous.
Updated writeup for distortion for clarification on the matrix M and distortion model.

Now that the practicum details have changed, is it possible to add it?
When I was investigating the practicum before the beginning of the semester, it just seemed that it would entail more frequent assignments/a larger focus on programming (essentially, more practice with the same material).

In the lecture today, it seemed like the focus of the practicum has shifted off of that, and will instead be more about advanced discussion of graphics, and extensions of existing assignments (meaning, learning more advanced material).

Knowing that information, and since there haven't been any practicum assignments yet, is it possible for someone in 4620 to add the practicum?

shape vertices getting shrunk to 1x1 square when moving handles
I'm currently implementing addInteractionsToHandle, and think I understand how to find the scaling ratios (convert mouse coordinates and old coordinates into scale space, then divide new by old), but am confused about what's happening when I try to actually update the model's transformation matrix.

Right now I'm calling model.setScale() with the scaling ratios I found, but the instant I move one of the handles the shape seems to move all its vertices into a box that is 1 wide and 1 tall. Would this be a problem with my renormalizeVertices implementation? I pass all the given test cases for that function.

Deadline adjustments for A4 and A5
Hi,

   In case some of you didn't see the announcement from canvas. There are some adjustments to the deadline. Copying Professor Marschner's announcement here: 

After reviewing feedback from this week's office hours, we decided we should loosen the schedule for the ray tracing assignments a bit, to give students some more time to work and more opportunities to seek help spread out over a longer period of time.  So we are going to push both ray tracing assignments (Rendering 1 and Rendering 2, aka. A4 and A5) back one week.  This makes A4 due on Nov 6 and A5 due on Nov 13.  A5 will still go out this week.

At the same time we are pushing back the A2 4621 extension to  be due Tuesday November 10.  And heads up that we are planning an A5 4621 extension to be due on Friday Nov 20.

attachToNewParent Test Cases Explanation
I was going through the provided test cases for attachToNewParent, and all of them seem to say that the specific model / node's matrix should remain unchanged after calling attachToNewParent. But doesn't the matrix for this node have to change in order to ensure that the scaling stays consistent in world coordinates when attaching to a new parent? Perhaps I'm missing something conceptually. 

I'm not sure where to go from here, because my old/current implementation seems to work fine for most cases when parenting, but when I change it to a solution that more so passes the test cases (after making the potential change found in @714), reparenting no longer works.

Every Model Always Has A Parent No Matter What / rootModel is ultimate parent?
We were trying to implement the setWorldPosition function with an if statement with two cases - either the model doesn't have a parent or model has a parent, but even when we just randomly created one object and tried to move it, it wouldn't move. We changed our setWorldPosition function to move to a position when a model DOES have a parent, and when we created a an object in the GUI with no parent and tried to move it, it did move. So then we console.logged this.getParent() and saw that the object with no parent has a parent which is root model. So does this mean that every single object has a parent no matter what?

This is confusing to me because a lot of the documentation is written with language that implies that if you have just one object, that object shouldn't already have a root model parent object, as the documentation asks us to consider when a model has no parent, and when it does. How would we go about implementing setWorldPosition then because if you have some if else structure :

It wouldn't ever make it into the else branch ever because every model has a parent. Is this the right thinking?

"methods setAdvisor1 and setAdvisor2 must change fields of both this PhD and its new advisor in order to maintain the class invariant,"

which seems to imply that setAdvisor2 should change the number of advisees. Immediately after this, the bolded important note mentions

"In setAdvisor1(p), p gets a new advisee, so p’s number of advisees increases. Do not mistake the number-of-advisees field for the number of advisors. There is a difference,"

Final S17 Question 2c


I don't see why the third line in the solution is necessary.

I understand that you want to exclude Person p's own pics, but pics are being gathered from people in the Set p.pals which should not include p anyway. 

I don't see why it would be reasonable to assume that a Person contains itself in its own Set of pals, which is the only situation that would necessitate that line.  No technical information was given on how the Set pals was actually populated, leaving us with nothing more than a common-sense definition.  I have never before seen a person included in his own list of friends.

Creating a greedy algorithm
How I am supposed to create a greedy algorithm that goes to a NodeStatus neighbor with minimum getDistanceToRing. Should I create a new sorting function to sort the collection of NodeStatus objects? Or should I define a comparator class for comparing NodeStatus objects on the basis of getDistanceToRing(). I'm really confused.

A6 - Estimated Length
Hi, I know that there is no suggested timetable for completing this assignment, but I want to ask:

How long should we plan to spend on this assignment, or how long do people usually take to complete this assignment?

A6 seems like it could be a shorter assignment, or a deceptively long assignment and I want to put in an appropriate amount of time and work.

Problem understanding A1 guideline
I have some problem understanding a part of A1 guideline.

The guideline says

 Did you write one (and only one) test procedure for each of the groups A, B, C, and D of step 4 and perhaps another for assert statements? Thus, do you have 4 or 5 test procedures? Does each procedure have a name that gives the reader an idea what the procedure is testing, so that a specification is not necessary? Did you write all the test cases as required in the discussion of each group above?

So does it mean we need to write another test procedure to test all assert statements? Do we need to do what we did in recitation this week (like all those assertThrow stuffs)? and also do we need to change procedure name from GroupA to something like testingConstructors?

Running GameState with run configurations
When I run GameState.java with the run configurations with a count greater than 1, every time it runs after the first time it fails to find the ring and produces the message in the console "Your solution to find returned at the wrong location". Additionally the first trial always works, it is only those after it that fail.

The Issue is that I can take that seed that appears to have failed and run it on its own in GUI.java and it's able to find the ring. I know this is not due to my solution taking too much time, as I often will still obtain a bonus over 1 on a seed that had failed. I have also tried increasing FIND_TIMEOUT in GameState.java but that has no effect. Could there just be some bug in my code that only comes through when I try to run multiple trials or is there some greater issue?
