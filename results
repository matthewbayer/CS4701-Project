How to test the spawn function in Project 1?
If I make some mistakes in understanding the spawn() function, please remind, thanks a lot.

If I run a program, let's say "project.c", the child process will run the project.c in the background, and the parent process will wait for the project.c terminating, when the project.c terminates normally in the background, print "process ** terminated with status **", or it will terminate abnormally and print other stuff. If this is correct, to run a program in the background, should I write a test program like "project.c" in the shall? If not, how to test the background running process and when it terminates?

Point deduction for LIFO/FIFO
Is there any chance of reducing the point deduction for LIFO/FIFO any further? I noticed that there was already a reduction in deduction that was made a short while ago which deducts fewer points if the same mistake was done on q04, and I felt better seeing that.

However, I still feel that the focus of this assignment is on the correct usage of semaphores/monitors, rather than LIFO/FIFO implementation which in the case of this assignment was simply a difference between deque.pop() and deque.popleft(). It is definitely on me that I didn't read carefully enough to notice the line on FIFO, but even so I don't feel like I should be getting 7 out of 10 points deducted for q03 when I did my concurrency (which should be the focus here) correctly. Along with the reduced point deduction of 3 points for q04, that adds up to a deduction of 10 points out of 40 points (including MCQ) which is 25% for a project that is worth 10% of our grade, which I feel is pretty significant.

I am really glad to see that point deductions have been reduced if the same mistake was made for both q03 and q04, but I still feel that too many points are being given to the correct implementation of FIFO when the focus of the project is really about concurrency, and I will be really happy if the deductions can be reduced further.

"lock" vs "mutex" in variable names
In the slides below (from Feb 20 lecture), is there a reason why the rcount_mutex has "mutex" in the variable name while rOw_lock has "lock" in its name when both are used to protect shared data?

Is this because rcount_mutex is used to enforce mutual exclusion on the rcount shared variable while rOw_lock is used for conditional synchronization between readers and writers?

Difference b/n str1 and str2 in part2_tester
Looking at the code for part2_tester it looks like it randomly chooses to write str1 or str2 to the file. But then inside of single_repeated_reader it checks if both str1 and str2 are equal to readbuf. Isn't it the case that only one should be equal, not both?

I printed the output of all three of these buffers and str2 is equal to readbuf, but str1 isn't. For this reason it's printing out an error. I guess I'm just confused why the if statement for that error is checking both str1 AND str2 instead of str1 OR str2.

Any advice could help me debug my part1, thanks!

EDIT: I realize now that this code is looped 10,000 times so both should get written to blocks roughly an equal amount, but since str1 and str2 are different, I'm not sure how they're ever both going to be equal to readbuf at the same time. This seems impossible.

rwlock vs mutex
My current understanding of the difference between a rwlock and a mutex is that rwlocks allow multiple readers and only one writer, while mutex locks allow only one of anything at a time to have the lock.

So, I believe we need to use rwlocks in this project. However, when I am waiting on a conditional variable, it requires a mutex to be passed in. If I use both a rwlock and a mutex, this defeats the whole purpose of using a rwlock anyways because the mutex has stricter guidelines.

How can I get around this? I think I'm missing something conceptually or I am not seeing a method that waits using a rwlock. I have gone through the documentation linked in another post.

Semantics of a recruiter waiting
With monitors there are two spots where you can end up waiting. Outside the critical section on acquiring the lock, and inside the critical section on a condition variable of the lock.

By saying that no student can enter while a recruiter is waiting, does that mean no student can enter when a recruiter is waiting on a conditional variable only (recruiter tried to enter the fair but got rejected), or does it mean that a student can't enter in both cases (the recruiter arrived at fair, but has not yet tried to enter because they have not gotten the lock, or the recruiter has gotten the lock to the fair but had to end up waiting inside the critical section)

So in other words is a recruiter considered waiting as soon as they try to acquire the lock to the fair (waiting in line for the checkpoint), or is a recruiter only considered waiting when they are waiting inside the critical section (got to the front of the line at some point, but then didn't get in the fair because it was full)

 Online Lecture and my new office hours
Dear all,

I hope this find you and your family well and safe.

We are about to restart our intellectual journey together: even I can see you rolling your eyes, I hope that deep inside (ok, perhaps really deep inside) you are excitedI

I wanted to share with you how lectures are going to proceed.

Lecture  -- Synchronous delivery

Following the University's guidelines, I am going to deliver lectures synchronously over Zoom at our normal times (Tuesdays and Thursdays, from 1:25 to 2:40 pm EST).

If you go to your calendar on Canvas, you should see entries for each of the classes, with a link that will allow you to join them. (You must be logged into Zoom via your Cornell ID: Choose the "Sign in via SSO" option in zoom.)

Lecture  -- Asynchronous delivery

Just as I did for the last lecture before our long recess, I will post both video and audio of the lectures in modules on Canvas.

Zoom call etiquette

Running a class of our size while trying to make it as interactive as possible is a challenge when we are together -- a virtual meeting makes it even more so.

Here is what we'll do:

-  Please enter by clicking on the zoom link on Canvas -- that way, you'll be automatically authenticated. You need to authenticate yourself to join the call.

- At the beginning of the call you will be muted. You can decide whether to keep your video on or off. Please consider keeping your video on: it's weird enough to teach into the void--at least, seeing some of you will make it less awkward. :-)

- If you would like to ask a question, please click on the Participants tab and then click on the small icon in the shape of a hand. I will periodically stop during the class and go through questions, and will unmute you to give you a chance to ask yours.

- Voicing your questions is the most effective way for us to focus on things that are unclear --but if you would rather not speak up, you can also ask me questions through chat. I will then read your question aloud and answer it.

My Office Hours

I will keep my 3:00 to 4:00 pm  office hour on Tuesdays, but I will move my office hour on Thursdays from 10:00 to 11:00 pm, to make it easier for those of you in a very different time zone.

See you soon!

Negative Points on True/False Questions
I received negative points on true/false questions that I answered incorrectly on the exam. Instead of being docked half a point, as was said on the exam, I was docked one and a half points. I submitted a regrade request, but was denied saying this is just how Gradescope works. Am I missing something? Shouldn't the lowest score I can get be a 0, not a negative number that takes away points from questions I answered correctly?

EDIT: I guess I understood the exam as saying you would have 0.5 subtracted if you got it incorrectly. Not that you receive -0.5 as your score. Thanks.

Points for part2
For the 10 points on style and correctness for part2, are we only gonna get graded on lock.h or is the node_layer also in consideration?

In terms of style, are there any specific things we need to take care of other than writing comments and naming etc?

As for correctness, do we need to consider things like starvation?

Thank you so much!

Regarding the no makeup exam policy
It seems that the policy to offer no makeup exams is inherently unfair to students with an exam conflict -- they only receive two opportunities to score well on the exams; everyone else gets 3. We can expect that the latter group will obtain higher overall grades on average.

If a student does not want to attend an exam and chooses to let it be dropped, that is their prerogative. But this is not an option at all for people with conflicts.

Moreover, some students have conflicts for more than one exam and, under the current policy, are likely to fail (or receive a very poor grade in) the course. As this course is required for the CS major, failure is not an option they can afford (and would prevent graduation for students in their final semester).

There are roughly 20 and 10 courses with the same respective exam dates as Prelim 1 and Prelim 2. There are 77 courses with the same final exam date and time as this course.

Several other large courses in the CS department (such as 1110 w/ ~500 students and 3110 w/ ~400 students) indeed offer make-up exams. Since there are 19 TAs for this class, it should not be difficult at all to proctor one or more make-ups per exam.

By University Faculty (Office of the Dean) policy: "Faculty members are urged to accommodate students’ requests for alternative exam times or make-up examinations when students’ exam schedules are sufficiently congested to warrant such accommodation. For example, a student facing a direct conflict or three or more examinations during one twenty-four hour time period merits such accommodation."

As another student mentioned, in the section about prelims: "If a student has conflicting examination schedules, both of which are on the schedule developed at the annual evening prelim scheduling meeting or both of which are not on the schedule, the instructors of the courses involved must consult and agree on how to resolve the conflict. Both instructors must approach this resolution process with a willingness to provide an alternative or early examination."

The Cornell University Registrar adds that the onus to provide a make-up exam is on a course "if [it] is the largest involved". This is likely the case for this course.

Respectfully, exam and university conflicts are typically out of students' control. (Other classes are important and required too.) Therefore, it would be reasonable and proper for make-up examinations to be offered. Please kindly give appropriate consideration again to the policy.

Practice Prelim 1 (Fall 2018) Question 2
The solution to this problem uses condition variables for each chopstick. Could one also use condition variables for each philosopher? In this scenario, the while loop condition would remain the same, but instead of waiting on cs1 and cs2, you wait on phil_i. Then, when a philosopher goes to sleep, instead of signaling the condition variables representing his or her chopsticks, you simply signal the philosophers to his or her right and left.

Macros, memcpy, read_bloc, and write_block
It seems to me that the read_block() and write_block() functions are significantly less useful than they could be, since they are forced to read and write the entire block. Giving them a size parameter would allow them to take the place of creating extra buffers and using memcpy() in read_file() and write_file().

First, am I missing anything that'd make this false, and if not, could we define macros for these improved functions and use them?

A4 Part 3 (Bonus) Scoring

However, no such thing is mentioned in the A4 readme about the bonus. Since the autograder comes very close to telling us how much credit we will get on parts 1 and 2, is such a policy going to be applied to A4 part 3?

 New project A4 released
Dear all,

please find below a link that will take you to the Github repo for A4.

https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/yz2327/A4

This is the project that takes the place of Prelim 2 and is weighted the same as Prelim 2 previously was  (namely 30% of the total grade) .

As I mentioned in responding to your questions in  @782, you have the option of counting for your credit any two of the following three : Prelim 1, A4, and the final.

The project will give you some experience in manipulating inodes,  the persistent data structures that the file systems keeps for each file it stores.

We are going to begin discussing file systems this week in class, but we want you to get started on this right away.  To get you going, Yunhao has (amazingly!) prepared a YouTube video that contains, we believe, all you need to attack the project starting tomorrow. You can find the video here:

https://youtu.be/EO7nBmw-Scc

and on Canvas under the Module "Intro to A4", which you should be able to reach from this link:

https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/11544/pages/a4-tutorial?module_item_id=435490

You can also find a pointer to it in the handout for the project you’ll find in the repo.

Office Hours

Every project increases the request for office hours. Besides, this is a new  project: we have worked very hard to work out all the kinks, but we have been, so to speak, building the car while driving it: most TAs will be doing the project just a few hours before you.

So, let’s talk about office hours.

I heard from some of you that some office hours have been busy, to the point that you have not been able to get the help you were looking for.  I have discussed this with the teaching staff and we have been exchanging ideas on how to make things more efficient and give to as many students as possible a chance to ask at least one of their questions during office hours.

But, let’s face it: the medium is inefficient: it is yet another thing that we have to recognize and, all of us, learn to live with: from the teaching staff side, it means trying to find ways to optimize the interactions; from your side, it means adapting your behavior so that you can get, in these circumstances, the best possible help.

Which brings me to another thing that I have learned from my TAs: almost all their office hours leading to A3 were empty — just tin the two/three days before the assignment was due there was a spike.

So, to recap:  1) you may need help; 2) office hours immediately before the deadline are unlikely to be able to absorb the load; 3) most office hours before the last bottleneck days are empty.

You are smart Cornell undergrads -- but here is a friendly hint ;-)

       start on your project NOW, and beat the rush.

And be done early: if you don’t  start thinking about it when the project is basically due and fall pray of the “fog of war”, it is a project you can finish relatively quickly.

Due Date


The project is due May 14, at 11:59 pm  Ithaca Time

A public ‘Thank you”

I have been touched by the dedication of the TAs in this class. Preparing a project from nothing takes hard work, and to do so while managing the challenging times we are in is truly spectacular. I realize that it is hard to be thankful to someone who has just created a new project for you to work on, but I hope you too appreciate their dedication.

The best way to repay them for the hard work is to get on with your project soon (today), and, while working at it, to remind yourself that the honor system we live by is a covenant of free people, who, free to be other than honorable, choose instead to be so.

Using more than 2 slip days on A4?
I noticed that on CMS, we can use a maximum of 2 slip days (i.e. the late submission deadline is Saturday, May 16th, 11:59 PM), but in @784_f4, one of the follow-ups said we could use all of the slip days we have left. There's a contradiction here - what is the maximum number of slip days we can use, and what date is the late submission deadline on, assuming I have never used a slip day?

Hw7 Q3
Hi, so if I understand the clocked diagonalization handout correctly, we need to lay off some number of tape cells where the number of tape cells we lay off is superpolynomial.

However, I can't find anything that's super.... 2 to the 2 to the 2 to n? I see that n! beats 2 to the n, but how can I know what beats our chained exponents?

Also, slight clarification: what exactly does "laying off" f(n) tape cells do for us? It seems like we're somehow using those f(n) cells to count f(n) steps, but how?

Sorry if these have already been explained but I read every piazza post on Q3 and diagonalization and still feel like I'm missing something

Question about Ackermann's function in class(9/16/2020)

In the class today, we defined Ackermann's function and its inverse.

Ackermann function is a function A: N^2 -> N where,

A(0,n) = n +1

A(m+1,0) = A(m,1)

A(m+1,n+1) = A(m, A(m+1,n))

But then we go over to some function Am(n), which is a fucntion from N -> N.

We define Am(n) as:

A0(n) = n+1

An+1(n) = do An n times to n

and we define the inverse of ackermann's function as the inverse of Am(n).

How does Ackermann's function A relate to Am(n)?

Proof that every GS execution provides a the "best" matching for men.
In OH this morning, Prof. Kozen explained the following proof of why the GS algorithm always provides a "best" matching for every man. I thought others might be interested in the proof in case you missed the explanation. Also, you can refer to the textbook for the full details (page 11). If anyone has any comments or suggestions for the proof, feel free to say.

Defn "best": for an arbitrary man m, let best(m) be the highest-ranked women, (in m's ranking) for which there exists a stable matching, M, with (m, best(m)) exists in M.

Claim: best is 1-1

Proof: Suppose there is an execution of GS, e, in which a man, m, is the first man who is rejected by his best valid partner. Then, m would have been rejected by a woman w (his best valid partner) in favor of another man, m1.

However, given that w and m are valid partners, there must be another stable matching S1 in which (m,w) exists. Now we ask, who would m1 be matched with in S1? Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that m1 is matched with a woman w1 ≠ w. We know that w prefers m1 to m, because in our initial execution, e, m is rejected by w in favor of m1. We also know that in e, m was the first man to be rejected by a valid partner. Therefore, in e, m1 had not been rejected by any valid parter at the time at which (m1 , w) was formed. Therefore, m1 must prefer w to w1. Therefore, in S1, there exists an instability in that w prefers m1 , and m1 prefers w, however (m1 , w) does not exist in S1. Because of this instability, we must reject our inital assumption that "there is an execution of GS, e, in which a man, m, is the first man who is rejected by his best valid partner."

Finally, every man must be paired with best(man) at the end of GS, and best is 1-1.

NP-complete, NP-hard, NP Definition
From lecture and a bit of researching online, NP stands for "non-deterministic polynomial time", and NP-complete problems, to my understanding, is basically a set of problems that cannot be solved in polynomial time (at least not with anything we have right now), and we reduce problems to other such problems to show they take a lot of time to solve. And, if we were to ever solve one, we could solve the others as well.

What is the difference between NP, NP-complete, and NP-hard? Will we go over this in lecture? The next few weeks of lectures will cover NP-complete, but not sure how it relates to NP and NP-hard. Also, is there anything else to keep in mind about NP-completeness besides that we can reduce a given problem to an NP-complete problem?

So as I understand an adjacency matrix is wasteful as not all other edges are being used for each edge, which means it makes sense to use an adjacency list. However, the reason adjacency matrices seemed appealing is because the edge values act as indices so you can store a value such as the edge type in it and have easy access to it if you just know the vertices. When switching to an adjacency list, you no longer have the waste issue but can no longer use vertices as indexes unless you use use something like a dictionary (I'm working in Python) which is recommended against as it's complex and slow. I'm just wondering how could we utilize an adjacency list while at the same time not making our structure inefficient?

grading optimality in the homework 2.
I am a little bit confused about the grading guideline in general. I made a "small" polynomial run-time algorithm, which was O(n^2logn) for hw2 question 2. However, I got penalized for not having optimal run-time of O(n), even though my reasoning about the run-time was correct. Piazza post @219 does say that "To clarify:  you do not need to provide the most efficient algorithm.  You need to provide any efficient algorithm.  Here "efficient" is defined as polynomial with respect to the input size".

The question does not state any upper-bound for this problem. So, what is an algorithm that is very unreasonable in run-time? I personally thought O(n^2logn) was reasonable, but two graders thought that it was unreasonable. How should we know about this upper-bound in a problem in general? I would like to know about this, as I would love to get full credit next time

I think the difference between Edmonds-Karp and Dinic is that Dinic employs a memoization dfs to find the augmenting path. However, I'm still a bit confused about how we analyzed its running time.

It seems like Advance, Retreat, and Augmenting recursively calls each others, so why can we analyze each running time as if they were paralleled? Is it because we analyzed the maximum number of times they get called no matter how they call each other?

And how does this search improve running time as compared to an ordinary depth first search?

Happy Election Day!
One of our problems on a previous homework was to detect if a set of precincts could be gerrymandered. Found an interesting (and relatively recent) article about using k-means clustering to generate non-gerrymandered district maps. Also, this definitely isn't the only article about "solving" gerrymandering and redistricting, but k-means clustering does seem to be a commonly used algorithm in fixing gerrymandering.

Does "problem A is an instance of problem B" = NP hard proof?
The hint for Q2 says that the dominating set problem is a special instance of Q2. If we know that dominating set is NP-hard, does that mean we automatically know that Q2 is NP-hard, and don't need to provide too much explanation for it? @1114 makes me think so.

On the other hand, if we can prove that one specific instance of problem B is NP-hard, does that mean B is NP-hard? Sorry, still wrapping my head around it.

Edit: Is this what's going on with the proof that TSP is NP-Hard using Hamiltonian Circuit? We reduce Hamiltonian Circuit to an extremely specific instance of Travelling Salesman using 1s and 2s for all distances?

When the handout describes CLIQUE, it seems to describe y as a subset of nodes K subset V, and phi checks if K has k nodes and is a clique. But why does phi(x,y) get to assume that y is a subgraph? And can it instead assume that y is a subgraph with k nodes so phi(x,y) only has to check if that subgraph is a clique, and doesn't have to check if it has k nodes?

Clarification on Shamos-Hoey Algorithm
I was reviewing my notes from today's lecture and am very confused. Some questions:

1) I don't understand how we return the closest point within each subproblem. How is y-distance taken into account? We keep splitting each subproblem in half by x-distance, so when we reach a base case with two elements, they are the closest in x-distance. But I don't understand how we are taking into consideration any of the other possibilities (i.e. points within a subproblem that are closer overall despite not being the closest in x-distance). Sorry if I am missing something super obvious.

2) If we compare the leftmost point of Qr and the rightmost point of Ql after performing the computations for the subproblems, and their distance is > delta, there is no need to do the post computation, right? We only do that if their distance is < delta? What if it is = to delta?

Thanks in advance :-)

Is reduction the only way to prove NP-completeness?
Hi,

    For example I want to prove A is NP-Complete and I already know B is NP-Complete. If I show that I can solve A by solving B plus some additional steps and additional steps take polynomial time, can I say that I proofed A is NP-complete? I am not doing any mapping of inputs here, and output of B is not equal to output of A.

    I am not sure is this also a reduction or this is a wrong approach.

Best.

Should number of comparisons be the number of elements that need to be compared to or the actual number of comparisons that need to take place? Currently having the debate about this because in an actual Java implementation you might compare a number to see if it's equal to the one to check for and if it's not then see if it is less than in order to decide between traversing the rest of the left or right side of the tree. Whereas in OCaml, you could use a single comparison that results in a GT, LT, or EQ output that could then be matched against, so that it would be only one comparison operation.

Do we need to draw out the whole search space (which is massive) or do we only need to do so until we hit the first goal state. 

I feel like its until we hit the first goal state, but the question says "identify the states that are goal states" which is scaring me.

MCTS on a graph
So it is possible if the game is not really a tree that treating it as such could lead to a lot of duplication. Does MCTS just treat the whole thing as a tree and not worry about it, or does it account for the possibility of getting to the same node from two different states. I don't see how it could do this accounting without fundamentally changing everything but just checking if there is some fancy optimization for real life scenarios where there is more than one route to a node and expansion/simulations from that node would be duplicated otherwise.

Backpropagation in Problem 2B
After doing backpropagation and updating the weights, the problem asks for the new output after the update. Does this mean I need to run forward propagation again with the new weights?

Also, is the error supposed to be the square of the difference between the desired output and the actual output, as defined in Lecture 28? This is what I saw in @481, but Lecture 31 also refers to the difference (without the square) as an error, and I don't think I've seen the sum of squares formula mentioned since Lecture 28.

unsharp_mask difference
Hello, the difference between my unsharp_mask image and the reference image is as follows:

It looks like only purely red, green, and blue pixels are the difference so I'm not really sure what could be going wrong. I am first clamping the output result to be between 0 and 255 and then converting to uint8. Does anyone have any advice? Thanks!!

Edit: Found out that for every pixel that is not equal, my sharpened image is off by one in one of R, G, and B. For example, at pixel [339, 374], my sharpened image has an RGB value of [117, 140,  49], while the reference image has an RGB value of [117, 141, 49] at that same pixel.

Mirror Reflection Making Image Much Brighter
Hi! I was working on A4 and was encountering an issue when implementing mirror reflection (the last suggested direction in the implementation strategy). 

When I add the mirror reflection code as detailed in the slides and the textbook, I end up with the following image (which does have mirroring, but the overall image becomes MUCH brighter than the reference):



As a reference, this is what happens to the output of running python three_spheres.py after commenting out the mirror reflection code (so bringing it back to the completion of step 5/6), and it does seem to match the provided reference image.



Any ideas to what could be causing this? I can manually add another constant coefficient to dampen the image, but that wouldn't match the given formula (and also seems to defeat the purpose of having a km value). The slides / textbook don't mention anything about scaling this extra light by a factor dependent on the distance between the two intersection points, or the depth, or something similar, which might help with this brightness issue. 

Could there be an issue with my illuminate code for point lights? 

Thanks!

Creating a variable number of new shapes for Creative portion
For the creative portion, I plan to create mirrored shapes of the original that are arranged around the original shape in a specific way. I would also like to create a slider that adjusts the number of "mirror" objects created- be it 1, 10, or 50. However, I'm stuck on how to change the number of shapes if the slider is adjusted post-initialization. From the starter code, every shape is created in initGeometry, and then their values/vertices are changed in updateShapes- new shapes are never created or destroyed.

Is there a way to create new shapes and have them persist while running updateShapes? Alternatively, is it possible to call initGeometry again while inside updateShapes (if it detects that the variable for # of shapes has changed) to reinitialize the scene?

Undistort bilinear interpolation not matching reference image
We implemented bilinear interpolation for undistort, and it created an image that we can't tell apart from the reference image (after flipping back and forth).

Similarly to @962, the identical bilinear interpolation code works for rotation (with a max difference of 1). But our difference image is different from the one in that post.

Even more peculiar: checking the diff on diffchecker produces a black diff. We tried swapping the subtraction order of our image and the reference image, and that produced a black diff as well (with a max difference of 1). We think it's because the uint8 rgb values are going negative and wrapping around. Is that passable?

We are testing our normal mapping using the normal map eye space reference image and the bumps seem to be the same but the color of the globe is lighter and we are not sure why. We are setting the final color to be (0.5 * new normal) + 0.5 for testing.

Conceptual question about get/setValueFunction in Interaction
I don't really understand what the functions get/setValueFunction in AIDragToMoveAnchorPoint and AIDragToMovePosition do. Could you explain it a little bit?

At first, I thought they are used to move the anchor and position of the object, but seems that we can still move the anchor and the position without implement these functions?

Slight differences between photos - step 2
Hi. There is a slight difference in our renders compared to the reference photos  at the end of step 2 that we can't figure out what the cause might be. In sphere_globe, it seems like the sphere is slightly moved and is not in the same position as the one in the references. (left one is our render - right one is the reference). 

Also in three_spheres_textured, there seems to be a large difference in the biggest sphere (mirror reflection probably) , but not in the smaller ones which is confusing for us to figure out why. 

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. thanks.

Handle locations not updating?
I have an issue with the centered controller, specifically when trying to resize more than once while the bounding box handles are still active.

If I resize/rotate once it's fine, but if I attempt again without deactivating the handles (clicking outside the shape), there's an issue.

I looked into this and it's because I'm relying on the values

view.handles[handleIndex].location
view.handles[pivotIndex].location
which don't seem to be updating on the 2nd attempt, if the handles aren't deactivated (i.e. the matrix & view both change, but the cursor vector remains the same)

An example is this below: Transforming the 1st image into the 2nd is fine, but when trying to transform the 2nd image, the diagonal vectors aren't updating (it thinks the lower-left hand corner is still the lower-right hand corner).



I'm wondering if there's a way to ensure this updates, or if I'm approaching it wrong? I'm currently using newCursor - oldCursor (

iaction.getEventPositionInContext(event)) to determine the change in diagonal, and (view.handles[handleIndex].location - view.handles[pivotIndex].location)/2 to determine the original diagonal.
Thank you so much!
UPDATE: It seems that I'm able to get the correct coordinates with
view.getModel().getWorldSpaceBBoxCorners() instead of view.handles, and it works fine now!

Issues with drawing new shape
When my partner and I add a new shape, occasionally it doesn't work and instead creates a line from the origin to the cursor, and it doesn't actually let you place the second point down, just follows the cursor. We can't really understand how our code would affect this since the error seems to be from functions that don't interact with our code. Should we be worried that there's something wrong with our code, or is this an error in the base code?

Reflections do not pick up background color?
I've implemented reflections, and I notice that my output below picks up quite a bit of the color of the background, which makes sense, since rays cast into the abyss get colored that way. Observe:

I believe the reference image is setting rays cast into empty space when depth > 0 to [0, 0, 0]. Is this the physically desirable behavior, or should we be doing what is shown above?

And for addInteractionstoAnchor, how can you get the old and current anchor position? I'm guessing you need that to apply the same translation to the origin?

Clarification from 10/8 Office Hours
For those who came to my office hours this morning, I do have a clarification on what this.matrix represents. What I described at the very end is the correct idea. I think Professor Marschner's phrasing of it is the easiest to understand: "The matrix property of a model is the node’s local transformation: the transformation from the node’s space to its parent’s space.  Then the parent’s matrix transforms from the parent’s space to the grandparent’s space, and so on all the way up to the root."

I know this can be super confusing though, so please post a follow-up here if you're still confused!

Dragging the shape into a line
Even if I save the original matrix before the drag, and don't modify the objectvertices at all, If I stop the drag precisely when the shape becomes a line (the x position is 0 in object space when I exit the drag), the transformation matrix's scale numbers become so small (extremely close to 0, or Precision.Smallest), a slight drag would then result in a very large scale change. Is this expected or am I doing something wrong?

The only way I was able to get around this was to set a larger minimum bound for scaling, such as 0.00001. I don't know if I am doing this completely wrong.

re-asking p shape is (360,640,3)
I apologize for repeating a question, but I don't believe that it was properly answered previously (for reference @1308).

The question that this user asked is why does hit.material.p have a shape of (360,640,3) in any instance? This is something that is happening to me as well. When I run the code print(np.array(hit.material.p).shape), it returns either a float "()" or an array of shape (360,640,3).

Now in the specifications, it says that hit.material.p can only be either a float or an array of shape (h,w). However I am getting array shapes (360,640,3) which are beyond the bounds of the specification.

Therefore, even though I am looking up uv for all parameters, I am getting incorrect values (since I am writing my code based on the provided specification).

I'm wondering if this is something that is supposed to happen (a mistake on my part), or something that was missed by the staff.

Thank you.

GroupChildren not functioning properly?
I've seen a few people with similar issues but no solution so I figured I'd make a new post. When I try pressing the GroupChildren button it creates a new group as a child of my shape as it should, but it doesn't reparent the shape's children as children of the group as well. It then gives me an error "A2DBoundingBoxView.js:32 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'dup' of undefined". As far as I can tell the only thing that could be causing this is maybe an issue with my removeFromParent or attachToNewParent functions, but they pass all the tests and work perfectly fine when I manually make shapes parents or children of each other. I followed the hint and used setMatrixAndPosition for these functions, is there something else I am missing that makes grouping work properly?

Casting classes/Abstract classes
I am kind of confused about why this expression is valid and why you would want to do it:

Shape sp= new Circle(5, 10, 2.5);

To me, this means that you are creating a Circle object that has a position and a radius, but sp "views" the object as a Shape object (from what I understand of casting classes). So, if sp "views" the object as a Shape object, why do you give it the radius 2.5 if, on the casting classes worksheet, something like sp.radius or sp.getRadius() would be "syntactically incorrect"?

Thanks!

Question in page 15 of lecture 2 slides


It says method "area" is in the object. It gives people an impression that the actual code of method "area" is stored in the object C@6667 on the memory.

But actual code of method "area" should be stored in the class C file and whenever object C@6667 needs to use the method, the program refers class C file to find the method "area".

I don't know how to better phrase this sentence. My attempt would be "The method is in the class C and a class C object has (access to) this method".
