Any transformation done by the user will simply be the result of changing the transformation matrix. Theoretically, we never need to transform the object at all in object space.

Could it be that the question was asking about what the P() function would do if it blocked and the thread never ran again()—ie. P() never finished?

I think for Tuesday quizzes it is pretty safe to assume that it will cover the previous 3 lectures (MWF) from the previous week as Professor Hirsh has mentioned.

 "Some AniGraph and Assignment 2 GUI updates\nHey Everyone,\nI just pushed some updates to AniGraphV2 and Assignment 2 that should make the creative portion of the assignment easier.\nNote: None of the files that you are supposed to edit for the core assignment have changed.\n\nMost of the changes are designed to help you explore more ambitious features in the creative portion of the assignment (if you want to). This will be especially relevant to students in 4621 who will have a separate deadline with more extensive requirements that we will elaborate on shortly. If you've already begun work on the creative part of the assignment, check for potential conflicts when pulling (if you aren't super familiar with git, you can always back up your code before you merge just to be safe). If you are still on the core assignment, you are unlikely to have any conflicts.\n\nYou may need to update submodules as well: git submodule update --init\n\nSummary of changes:\nThe changes in code related to the core part of the assignment are minor; you probably won't notice if you haven't gotten to the creative part yet:\n\nIf you create a new shape while an existing node is selected, then the new shape is introduced as a child of the selected node. This should make testing a bit easier / less tedious.\nThe Group selection mode will now bound the first ancestor group (once the related functions in A2Model have been implemented), instead of everything up to the children of the root node. This should make creating animations easier.\nMost of the changes are in the ./src/creative folder:\n\nThe creative page now has switchable tabs on the left:\none for editing shapes (similar to what you had in A1)\none for editing the scene graph (the same interface you have in the core part of A2)\none for custom controls, which should be much easier to specify in creative.jsx now.\nThe custom controls tab has a dropdown menu for changing a selected shape's view class.\nThere is an example custom view class (ATimeView) showing how to create time-varying effects.\nI will release a video showing some features of the new code later today.\n\nBest,\n-Abe",

 'Proof that every GS execution provides a the "best" matching for men.\nIn OH this morning, Prof. Kozen explained the following proof of why the GS algorithm always provides a "best" matching for every man. I thought others might be interested in the proof in case you missed the explanation. Also, you can refer to the textbook for the full details (page 11). If anyone has any comments or suggestions for the proof, feel free to say.\n\nDefn "best": for an arbitrary man m, let best(m) be the highest-ranked women, (in m\'s ranking) for which there exists a stable matching, M, with (m, best(m)) exists in M.\n\nClaim: best is 1-1\n\nProof: Suppose there is an execution of GS, e, in which a man, m, is the first man who is rejected by his best valid partner. Then, m would have been rejected by a woman w (his best valid partner) in favor of another man, m1.\n\nHowever, given that w and m are valid partners, there must be another stable matching S1 in which (m,w) exists. Now we ask, who would m1 be matched with in S1? Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that m1 is matched with a woman w1 ≠ w. We know that w prefers m1 to m, because in our initial execution, e, m is rejected by w in favor of m1. We also know that in e, m was the first man to be rejected by a valid partner. Therefore, in e, m1 had not been rejected by any valid parter at the time at which (m1 , w) was formed. Therefore, m1 must prefer w to w1. Therefore, in S1, there exists an instability in that w prefers m1 , and m1 prefers w, however (m1 , w) does not exist in S1. Because of this instability, we must reject our inital assumption that "there is an execution of GS, e, in which a man, m, is the first man who is rejected by his best valid partner."\n\nFinally, every man must be paired with best(man) at the end of GS, and best is 1-1.',

 "WidthAtDepth: stepwise refinement and appropriate recursive thoughts\nINTRODUCTION\nPeople who have trouble with widthAtDepth are probably thinking too much about how recursion works and\n\nnot about how we said to understand recursive functions or develop them. Secondly, too many people\n\nare not using what we call stepwise refinement in developing these A4 methods. Were you taught stepwise\n\nrefinement in your first programming class? It's a pity if you were not. It is a fairly obvious methodology,\n\nwhich was first explained in a paper by Niklaus Wirth in about 1972. Everyone sort of uses it,\nbut being more aware of what one is doing and using it consciously can be a big help.\n\n \n\nWe have three videos on stepwise refinement in the JavaHyperText —look in the top horizontal navigation bars.\n\nWe have two videos on recursion n trees. If you have not watched them, stop what you are doing and watch them!\n\n\nHere, also, we try to get these ideas across to you using two examples and then discussing WidthAtDepth.\nYou should use the ideas expressed below in developing ALL you recursive methods.\nPlease read slowly and carefully.\n\nAN EXAMPLE OF STEPWISE REFINEMENT\n\nSuppose I ask you to write this method.\n\n     /** Print the names of the children of t. */\n     public void printChildren(BugTree t) { ... }\n\nI do this in stepwise fashion by writing the method body like this:\n\n     for (BugTree child : t.children) {\n        Print the name of child\n     }\n\nI concentrated on getting the loop right, and to be able to focus on that, I wrote the loop body in English.\nNow, I see how to implement the loop body. I end up with this:\n\n     for (BugTree child : t.children) {\n        // Print the name of child\n        System.out.println(child.root.getName());\n     }\n\nI cannot emphasize too much this method of stepwise refinement, of doing one thing\nat a time, writing all but what one is concentrating on in English. We may not need it\nin this simple example, but in many cases, being methodical and careful like this will\nlead you to a correct solution, and with much less trouble than simply hacking around.\n\n \n\nA SECOND EXAMPLE OF STEPWISE REFINEMENT\n\nNow consider writing the method below, assuming that we can't use children.size.\n\n     /** Print the number of children of t. */\n     public void printNumberOfChildren(BugTree t)\n\nSince we can't use children.size, we have to write a loop to count the number of children.\nSo we write the following. Look! The loop body is in English. Get used to writing what the\nloop body is supposed to do in English! Until you have more experience programming and\nthings go easier.\n\n \n\nI did do one more step; I put in the line to print after the loop ended.\n\n     int sum= 0;\n     //invariant: sum contains the number of iterations executed so far.\n     for (BugTree child : t.children) {\n        // Add 1 to sum\n    }\n    System.out.println(sum);\n\nNow we have to implement the loop body --put in sum= sum + 1; .\n\nNOW ABOUT WIDTH AT DEPTH\n\n \n\nNow consider writing this method.\n\n   /** Return the width of this tree at depth d */\n   public int widthAtDepth(int d)\n\nThere is a hint in the body:\n\n       // If d > 0, the answer is: sum of widths of the children at depth d-1.\n\nRead the line above carefully!\nIt gives you a recursive definition of width of the tree at depth d.\nAll you have to do is translate that definition into Java!\nAll you have to do is translate that definition into Java!\n\nOnce more, for emphasis: All you have to do is translate that definition into Java!\n\nNow, use stepwise refinement to implement the recursive case, just as\nwe did in the two above examples. Write the loop body in English. Pay attention\nto the similarity of this example with the second example above.\n\nAfter you do that, you have to implement the loop body. Here is where recursion\ncome in. Do NOT think about how recursion works. That will only confuse you.\nInstead: Compare what has to be done ---your English in the loop body---\nwith the specification of function widthAtDepth and write a recursive call.\n\nIt would be nice to get feedback in follow-up to see whether this helped.",

 "A3 Clarification Questions\nHi! I just had two clarification questions about assignment 3:\n\nIn @842 and the Distortion notebook, it says to use black for points that fall out of bounds when doing linear interpolation on the rotated image. However, the reference linear interpolation image seems to be using pixels at the border instead of black when calculating out-of-bounds values. Should we also be using the pixels at the border when doing linear interpolation, or should we leave them as black? The reference nearest-neighbor rotation image seems to use black for the out-of-bounds pixel values.\nIn the Filtering notebook, the spec for convolve_sep says that it takes in the 2d filter, and convolves the image using its separable filters. Are we supposed to be able to handle any separable filter f in this function, or can we assume it is the (square) output of gen_gaussian_filter? If we are supposed to be able to handle any separable filter, how are we supposed to be able to separate the filter in general before running the convolutions?

When switching to an adjacency list, you no longer have the waste issue but can no longer use vertices as indexes unless you use use something like a dictionary (I'm working in Python) which is recommended against as it's complex and slow.

I believe this means that the tests are trying to test these methods on models (NOT GROUPS) that have no vertices... is this intended?\n\nWhen running my application in browser, I never see an empty list printed to the console, since you can't even create a model without any geometry in browser.\n\nIf it is the case that there's nothing wrong with the tests, why am I seeing empty object space corners for the models being tested? Do these tests intend to test models without geometry?",

How is it then possible for J3 to be interrupted at t = 110 and be taken over by J4? It has only used up one-quarter of its assigned time slice, and it has 20 time units left before it is complete. Shouldn't J3 thus be allowed to run until completion until t = 130?\n\nEdit: Nvm I understood why now.",

 'q06 boarding at the same time\nThe question says that students who are going in the same direction can go at once.\n\nTo me that seems to mean that given that the light is in their favor a student should never touch any semaphore in any way because that would involve synchronizing between threads (can\'t even do a V operation because then the students are not entering at the same time as one V goes through first).\n\nHowever if the light is not in their favor then the student would have to end up calling P on a semaphore that is at 0 in order to suspend, and that student would only be able to enter once it is no longer 0 which could only be accomplished by a student who has the light in their favor touching a semaphore.\n\nThis is a contradiction so my interpretation of the spec is impossible. So what are we to interpret "cross at once" to mean, as there is no way for two students to board at the exact same time without there being some synchronization between them.\n\nIf an implementation satisfied: as long as the light is for boarding and a student is trying to board then the light will not switch and no student can depart, and vice versa for departing, would that count as a proper implementation. Even though students still are boarding one at a time technically rather than at once, but this seems like the only possible way. ',

 'giving students grade feedback\nOne of the downsides of replacing the prelim and final with quizzes is that you no longer have a big-ticket item - the prelim - midway through the semester giving you a sense for how you are doing gradewise this semester.  I know that is making many students uneasy, whether or not they are going S/U.\n\nI\'ve been thinking about how I can give you some feedback to replace what you would usually get from a prelim, and settled on the following: Later this week (either Friday or over the weekend) I will compute two "mock grades" for each of you.  For the first I will rescale your total Tuesday and Thursday quiz scores to 37.5% each, and your homeworks to 25%, and compute what kind of grades you\'d get if you performed at that level for the rest of the semester.  I think many of you who are worried about even just passing the class will be reassured by what they see.\n\nHowever, the quiz form we\'re using is a blunt instrument, and some of you may feel like you had some bad runs of luck, particularly on questions that are True/False.  First, note that luck is an even-handed force, and the reason for having repeated quizzes is so that it averages out in the long run, both in terms of you potentially doing better moving ahead, and in terms of others having their own bad runs of luck at times when you don\'t.  To give you a sense for how things might go for the rest of the semester what I\'m going to do is compute a second grade for each of you, one where instead of scaling quizzes to 37.5% and homeworks to 25% I will instead replace the missing quizzes/homeworks with the median grades from the first calculation above so that the total score approximates what you\'d get if you perform at median class level for the rest of the semester.  I will then assign you a grade using the scale from the first set of grades.  This gives you an approximate answer to, "I thought I was following things but messed up on some quizzes/homework, how much damage will that cause me if I otherwise do decently for the rest of the semester?".\n\nSome students going S/U are worried about even just getting an S.  I am confident that the above exercise will reassure those students.  For those of you still thinking about a letter grade, I\'ll use this as my latest chance to remind you: If you\'re the type for whom worrying about grades can be extremely stressful, it must be even more stressful this semester.  The S/U option was introduced precisely because of this.  It is a stress you don\'t need to experience this semester, on top of all the other stresses that may have been introduced into your life over the last month and a half.  (And I am pleased by how many of you have now made that switch without letting it hang over you for the rest of the semester.)',

How does having/not having multi-threading impact interrupt-safety?\n\nIs it related to the deadlock concern when one thread acquires lock L, is interrupted, and then the interrupt handler blocks on trying to acquire lock L as well?\n\nIn that case, how is this check ("interrupt safety in absence of multi-threading") different from the first half of the second check ("both interrupt- and thread-safe")? If the first check is False, then is the second check necessarily False as well?\n\nThanks!',

 "Running Time of Dijkstra\nI was trying to understand why Dijkstra has a running time of O(mlogn) instead of O(nlgn) or something at least containing a linear n. So the most outer loop, though it seems like it's operating on nodes, is actually a loop about edges. (I don't know whether I'm right about this. If I am, I think this statement can help me solve my question below) We maintain a priority queue of nodes and the only reason that priority queue gets updated is that some edges are visited. So for each edge, we either query the distance but not update it O(1) or update it O(logn). That is and we get an O(mlogn)\nThen it comes the confusing part for me. It seems the set of currently visiting nodes (grey nodes) can have at most n elements and each extractMin operation takes logn time so it should be O(nlogn)?\n\nOr does it have nothing to do with n in the first place, even though when we write the code, we would write while(!q.empty()){ ... }? We are simply extracting elements from the priority queue already updated by the previous O(mlogn) step and a simple query should only take O(logn) time?",

 ' Prelim 1 - a few notes\nDear all,\n\nI am about to release the grades for Prelim 1, and I thought I should accompany them with some remarks.\n\nFirst, I understand that a question many of you have is whether, pst COVID, the offer of dropping this prelim is still valid. The answer is yes.\n\nWhatever is going to be the percentage of the final credit in the class  that is going to be based on exams, it is going to be computed either using solely the final exam or by splitting it across  both the final and the prelim exam, whatever is going to be best for you.\n\nSecond, the statistics that you will find on Gradescope are inaccurate because they use an incorrect total -- it is using 91; it should use 82; further, all of you have earned one point more that waht Gradescope reports. Explanation below:\n\n----------\n\nGradescope computed the  maximum possible score to be  91-- it came to that number by computing the sum of all the points that could be earned in the exam.\n\nIn computing your score, it did not count the one point you earned by filling in your Cornell id--so, you should mentally add 1 to both your score and to the maximum possible score ---so that the latter grows to 92.\n\nWe get down from 92 to 82 because I have decided to count part 2 of the last question (worth 10 points) as extra credit.\n\n----------\n\nHere are the accurate numbers:\n\nAverage:  44.1       (53.7%)\n\nMedian:   44          (53.7%)\n\nSt.Dev:      9.3\n\nMin:         23.5       (28.7%)\n\nMax:        70          (85.4%)\n\nFinally, let me just say, not in a judgmental way, but as your partner in this intellectual journey: you can do much better, and you should do much better.\n\nI am *not* saying "You could have done better" ---I very much realize that, for many of you, it was very hard to concentrate on the exam with all that was happening around you.   I am saying, however, that you can now.\n\nThis is the time to regroup and fully engage in what I think is the long lasting lesson of this class, even for those of you who are never going to write a line of operating systems code---how to manage complex systems (not even necessarily computer systems!)  through elegant , powerful, and efficient abstractions.\n\nIt was great seeing so many of you on line today. Keep the questions coming during lecture. I am looking forward to seeing you on line soon.\n\nStay safe!',

 ' Regarding the no makeup exam policy\nIt seems that the policy to offer no makeup exams is inherently unfair to students with an exam conflict -- they only receive two opportunities to score well on the exams; everyone else gets 3. We can expect that the latter group will obtain higher overall grades on average.\n\nIf a student does not want to attend an exam and chooses to let it be dropped, that is their prerogative. But this is not an option at all for people with conflicts.\n\nMoreover, some students have conflicts for more than one exam and, under the current policy, are likely to fail (or receive a very poor grade in) the course. As this course is required for the CS major, failure is not an option they can afford (and would prevent graduation for students in their final semester).\n\nThere are roughly 20 and 10 courses with the same respective exam dates as Prelim 1 and Prelim 2. There are 77 courses with the same final exam date and time as this course.\n\nSeveral other large courses in the CS department (such as 1110 w/ ~500 students and 3110 w/ ~400 students) indeed offer make-up exams. Since there are 19 TAs for this class, it should not be difficult at all to proctor one or more make-ups per exam.\n\nBy University Faculty (Office of the Dean) policy: "Faculty members are urged to accommodate students’ requests for alternative exam times or make-up examinations when students’ exam schedules are sufficiently congested to warrant such accommodation. For example, a student facing a direct conflict or three or more examinations during one twenty-four hour time period merits such accommodation."\n\nAs another student mentioned, in the section about prelims: "If a student has conflicting examination schedules, both of which are on the schedule developed at the annual evening prelim scheduling meeting or both of which are not on the schedule, the instructors of the courses involved must consult and agree on how to resolve the conflict. Both instructors must approach this resolution process with a willingness to provide an alternative or early examination."\n\nThe Cornell University Registrar adds that the onus to provide a make-up exam is on a course "if [it] is the largest involved". This is likely the case for this course.\n\nRespectfully, exam and university conflicts are typically out of students\' control. (Other classes are important and required too.) Therefore, it would be reasonable and proper for make-up examinations to be offered. Please kindly give appropriate consideration again to the policy.',

It is good practice. 2. Even though it may be obvious to you, it is often not obvious to us that it is obvious to you. Don\'t make us guess!\n\nIn general, the answer to the question, "Can I assume..." is: Yes, make whatever assumptions you need to make to solve the problem and do a nice job under those assumptions. You may lose some points if your solution is not sufficiently general, but do what you need to do. We would rather see a nice solution to a restricted version of the problem than an incorrect solution to the more general problem.',

 "academic integrity in difficult times\nI'm not sure how widely this has been distributed, but the university released a new academic integrity statement in light of our reliance on online teaching and assessment this semester.  You can find it at link.\n\nAt some level you already know what it says.  You know when your behavior is admirable and when it is not.  My responsibility is to be clear about where the boundary is, much of which is already laid out on the original course website.  I will continue to do my best to do so as we move ahead.  For example, you may wonder if quizzes are open or closed book and notes.  I don't know yet, I still need to come up with some of the quiz questions that I plan to use before making that decision.  But either way I will let you know ASAP, before the quizzes start up, so that it's not a question for you.\n\nI've thought a lot about how to manage academic integrity issues in our new course setting.  Talking about it solely in terms of rules and punishments avoids having to confront the underlying causes of academic dishonesty, so let me briefly turn to that.  Those who make college academic integrity a topic of their research have compiled list of common reasons for why students cheat.  Pressure to get high grades is one of them, and we have a lot of that here but we also have this semester's unique S/U policy, which is about diminishing that pressure. Another is parental pressures, which I also discussed in my earlier note.  Another is pressure to get a job, and I've also already discussed the neutral position of this semester's S/U grades on job search.  Another is a desire to excel, which is an admirable trait that you should maintain, but with an understanding that doing so through dishonesty isn't actually excelling it's cheating.  The other reasons they have identified for cheating?  Laziness, lack of responsibility, lack of character, poor self-image, a lack of pride in a job well done, and lack of personal integrity.  None of which I believe you will want to see when you later look into the mirror.\n\nWe are in a time of stress.  How we behave under stress reveals our character. This is both a statement about each of us individually - what we would want to see in the mirror when we look back at this time - and about our society and what values we believe it embodies.  It's also a statement of putting your trust in others, that they will similarly exhibit the best of behaviors.  If you find yourself in a situation where you are tempted to violate Cornell's academic community standards, don't.  Contact me about what in your life has made it difficult to keep up with the course within the behavioral expectations of being a Cornell student and let's see what we can do about it.  Notice that I didn't say come see me and tell me why you want to cheat, because what I'm seeking isn't just something to do when you feel like cheating.  Please let me if there are forces in your life that are making progress in the course in our current circumstances difficult for you.",

I've tested this on small sample sizes, and I believe that it is always possible to schedule it in n weekends, but I'm not sure how to prove it without just fully solving the problem.

It is definitely on me that I didn't read carefully enough to notice the line on FIFO, but even so I don't feel like I should be getting 7 out of 10 points deducted for q03 when I did my concurrency (which should be the focus here) correctly. Along with the reduced point deduction of 3 points for q04, that adds up to a deduction of 10 points out of 40 points (including MCQ) which is 25% for a project that is worth 10% of our grade, which I feel is pretty significant.\n\nI am really glad to see that point deductions have been reduced if the same mistake was made for both q03 and q04, but I still feel that too many points are being given to the correct implementation of FIFO when the focus of the project is really about concurrency, and I will be really happy if the deductions can be reduced further.",

This has been true since the early days of AI (e.g., search algorithms such as A* that aim to find the optimal path to a goal state), and this paradigm is common to AI, statistics, control theory, operations research, and economics. Loosely speaking, the field has evaluated the intelligence of an AI system by how efficiently and effectively it optimizes for _its_ objective. This talk will provide an overview of my thesis work, which proposes and explores the consequences of a simple, but consequential, shift in perspective: we should measure the intelligence of an AI system by its ability to optimize for _our_ objectives.\n\n \n\nIn an ideal world, these measurements would be the same -- all we have to do is write down the correct objective! This is easier said than done: misalignment between the behavior a system designer actually wants and the behavior incentivized by the reward or loss functions they specify is routine, it is commonly observed in a wide variety of practical applications, and fundamental, as a consequence of limited human cognitive capacity. This talk will build up a formal model of this value alignment problem as a cooperative human-robot interaction: an assistance game of partial information between a human principal and an autonomous agent. It will begin with a discussion of a simple instantiation of this game where the human designer takes one action, write down a proxy objective, and the robot attempts to optimize for the true objective by treating the observed proxy as evidence about the intended goal. Next, I will generalize this model to introduce Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning, a general and formal model of this assistance game, and discuss the design of efficient algorithms to solve it. The talk will conclude with a discussion of directions for further research including applications to content recommendation and home robotics, the development of reliable and robust design environments for AI objectives, and the theoretical study of AI regulation by society as a value alignment problem with multiple human principals.",
